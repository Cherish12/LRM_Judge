He's a medical student or trainee doing rotations\n\n9. He's providing transportation services for patients\n\n10.

The cars are yellow, green, purple, red, and blue, and the executives' names are Alice, Bert, Cheryl, David, and Enid.\n* The car in the first space is red.\n* A blue car is parked between the red car and the green car.\n* The car in the last space is purple.\n* The secretary drives a yellow car.\n* Alice's car is parked next to David's.\n* Enid drives a green car.\n* Bert's car is parked between Cheryl's and Enid's.\n* David's car is parked in the last space.\nQuestion: What is the name of the secretary?",

The car in the last space is purple.\n4. The secretary drives a yellow car.\n5. Alice's car is parked next to David's.\n6. Enid drives a green car.\n7. Bert's car is parked between Cheryl's and Enid's.\n8. David's car is parked in the last space.\n\nFrom clue 8, we know that David's car is in the last space, which is purple (from clue 3).\n\nSince there are five spaces, and the red car is in the first space (from clue 1), the order of colors starts with red and ends with purple:\n\n1. Red\n2. ???\n3. ???\n4. ???\n5. Purple (David)\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that a blue car is between the red car and the green car. Thus, the arrangement could be:\n\n1. Red\n2. Blue\n3. Green\n4. ???\n5. Purple (David)\n\nFrom clue 6, Enid drives a green car, so Enid is in the third space.\n\nNow, let's use clue 7: Bert's car is between Cheryl's and Enid's. The only available space for Bert, between other people, is the second space:\n\n1. Red\n2. Bert (Blue)\n3. Enid (Green)\n4. Cheryl\n5. David (Purple)\n\nClue 4 tells us the secretary drives a yellow car, which must be in the fourth space that is still unaccounted for:\n\n1. Red\n2. Bert (Blue)\n3. Enid (Green)\n4. Secretary (Yellow)\n5. David (Purple)\n\nAlice's car is parked next to David's (clue 5), thus Alice's car must be the red car in the first space:\n\n1. Alice (Red)\n2. Bert (Blue)\n3. Enid (Green)\n4. Secretary (Yellow)\n5. David (Purple)\n\nFinally, since the only unassigned name is Cheryl, and she must be in space 4, where the secretary is:\n\nCheryl is the secretary.\n\nTherefore, the name of the secretary is Cheryl.",
        "response_B": "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1.

Given the order of spaces and the color information:\n* The blue car must be in the second space\n* The green car must be in the third space\n* We know the first is red and last is purple\n* Therefore, the yellow car must be in the fourth space (secretary's position)\n\n3. About the people:\n* David is in the last space (treasurer) with the purple car\n* Enid has the green car (third space)\n* Bert is between Cheryl and Enid\n* Alice is next to David\n\n4. Since we know the yellow car belongs to the secretary and is in the fourth space, and Alice must be next to David (who is in the last space), Alice must be the secretary.\n\nTherefore, Alice is the secretary.",

Now, let's look at the third statement which has two parts:\n   * Bananas cost more than apples\n   * Bananas cost more than oranges\n\n4. Analyzing each part:\n   * Bananas cost more than apples - This is TRUE because if Bananas > Oranges and Oranges > Apples, then Bananas > Apples\n   * Bananas cost more than oranges - This is TRUE as given in statement 2\n\n5.

When Suresh is standing facing the pole, and the shadow of the pole falls exactly to his right, the shadow must be cast in the direction opposite to the rising sun, which is towards the west.\n\nTo visualize this, if you are facing the pole and the east is in front of you (since the sun is rising), your right side would naturally correspond to the south direction.

        "response_B": "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's recall how shadows work with the Sun:\n   * The Sun rises in the east\n   * The Sun sets in the west\n   * Shadows always point in the direction opposite to the Sun's position\n\n2) We know it's morning after sunrise:\n   * The Sun is in the eastern part of the sky\n   * When the Sun is in the east, shadows point to the west\n\n3) We're also told that:\n   * Suresh is facing the pole\n   * The shadow falls exactly to his right\n\n4) If the shadow is falling to Suresh's right:\n   * Suresh must be facing north\n   * Because when facing north, your right side points east\n\n5) However, remember that shadows point opposite to the Sun:\n   * Since the Sun is in the east\n   * The shadow must be pointing west\n\nTherefore, the shadow was pointing WEST.",

Which situation should the aides report to the principal?\na) An unengaged girl is sitting alone on a bench, engrossed in a book and showing no interaction with her peers.\nb) Two boys engaged in a one-on-one basketball game are involved in a heated argument regarding the last scored basket.\nc) A group of four girls has surrounded another girl and appears to have taken possession of her backpack.\nd) Three boys are huddled over a handheld video game, which is against the rules and not permitted on school grounds.",
        "response_A": "The correct answer is c) A group of four girls has surrounded another girl and appears to have taken possession of her backpack.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. This situation shows clear signs of potential bullying:\n- Multiple students (4) targeting a single student\n- Taking possession of personal property\n- Surrounding/intimidating behavior\n- Power imbalance (group vs. individual)\n\n2. Let's analyze why the other options are less urgent:\n\na) The girl reading alone:\n- Shows no signs of distress\n- Could be a personal choice\n- No conflict or harassment involved\n\nb) The basketball argument:\n- Is a typical competitive dispute\n- Involves equal participants\n- Part of normal social learning\n- Can likely be resolved through standard conflict resolution\n\nd) The video game violation:\n- While against school rules\n- Is a disciplinary issue, not bullying\n- Shows cooperative rather than aggressive behavior\n\n3. The principal specifically asked about bullying, and option c) displays classic bullying characteristics:\n- Intentional aggressive behavior\n- Power imbalance\n- Potential for physical or emotional harm\n- Taking of personal property\n\nTherefore, option c) represents the most serious situation that aligns with the principal's concern about bullying and requires immediate reporting.",
        "response_B": "The aides should report situation c) to the principal: \"A group of four girls has surrounded another girl and appears to have taken possession of her backpack.\" This scenario suggests a potential bullying situation, as it involves a group exerting power over an individual and possibly taking her belongings without consent.
