This ensures that the binary search is applied to the shorter array.\n\n2. **Initialize `imin`, `imax`,`half_len`:**\n   - `imin = 0`, `imax = m`, `half_len = (m + n + 1) // 2`.\n   - The `half_len` is the half point we want to reach when combining both arrays.\n\n3. **Binary Search:**\n   - Perform binary search on nums1 (smaller array) using two pointers, `imin` and `imax`.\n   - Find partition indices `i` and `j` such that:\n     - `i` is the partition index for nums1. It ranges from `0` to `m`.\n     - `j = half_len - i` is the partition index for nums2.\n   - Check conditions for a perfect partition:\n     - If `i < m` and `nums2[j-1] > nums1[i]`, increase `i` (i.e., `imin = i + 1`).\n     - If `i > 0` and `nums1[i-1] > nums2[j]`, decrease `i` (i.e., `imax = i - 1`).\n     - Otherwise, you have found the correct partition.\n\n4. **Calculate the median:**\n   - Find the max element on the left side, which is `max_of_left`.\n     - If `i == 0`, it means nums1 contributes no elements to the left part, so `max_of_left = nums2[j-1]`.\n     - If `j == 0`, it means nums2 contributes no elements to the left part, so `max_of_left = nums1[i-1]`.\n     - Otherwise, `max_of_left = max(nums1[i-1], nums2[j-1])`.\n   - If `(m + n)` is odd, the median is `max_of_left`.\n   - If `(m + n)` is even:\n     - Find the min element on the right side, which is `min_of_right`.\n     - If `i == m`, it means nums1 contributes no elements to the right part, so `min_of_right = nums2[j]`.\n     - If `j == n`, it means nums2 contributes no elements to the right part, so `min_of_right = nums1[i]`.\n     - Otherwise, `min_of_right = min(nums1[i], nums2[j])`.\n     - The median is `(max_of_left + min_of_right) / 2.0`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python\ndef findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2):\n    # Ensure nums1 is the smaller array\n    if len(nums1) > len(nums2):\n        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1\n\n    m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)\n    imin, imax, half_len = 0, m, (m + n + 1) // 2\n\n    while imin <= imax:\n        i = (imin + imax) // 2\n        j = half_len - i\n\n        if i < m and nums2[j-1] > nums1[i]:\n            # Increase i\n            imin = i + 1\n        elif i > 0 and nums1[i-1] > nums2[j]:\n            # Decrease i\n            imax = i - 1\n        else:\n            # Perfect partition found\n            if i == 0: max_of_left = nums2[j-1]\n            elif j == 0: max_of_left = nums1[i-1]\n            else: max_of_left = max(nums1[i-1], nums2[j-1])\n\n            if (m + n) % 2 == 1:\n                return max_of_left\n\n            if i == m: min_of_right = nums2[j]\n            elif j == n: min_of_right = nums1[i]\n            else: min_of_right = min(nums1[i], nums2[j])\n\n            return (max_of_left + min_of_right) / 2.0\n\n# Example usages:\nprint(findMedianSortedArrays([1, 3], [2]))        # Output: 2.0\nprint(findMedianSortedArrays([1, 2], [3, 4]))     # Output: 2.5\n```\n\nThis implementation employs a binary search, operating in \\(O(\\log(\\min(m, n)))\\) time complexity, which is very efficient for this problem.",

        "response_A": "To solve the problem of implementing regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'`, we can use dynamic programming (DP). The goal is to check if the entire string `s` matches the pattern `p`.\n\nHere's the plan:\n- We'll define a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the first `i` characters of `s` match the first `j` characters of `p`, and `False` otherwise.\n- The table will have dimensions `(len(s)+1) x (len(p)+1)` to account for the possibility of both strings being empty.\n- We'll initialize `dp[0][0]` to `True` since an empty pattern matches an empty string.\n- For `dp[0][j]` when `j > 0`, we'll check the pattern `p` for any valid pattern matches that could match an empty string, such as patterns with stars: e.g., `a*`, `b*`, `.*`, etc., but only if they appear in valid sequences from the start of `p`.\n- We'll iteratively fill in the DP table by comparing characters and handling `.` and `*` appropriately.\n\nHere's how to implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\ndef isMatch(s: str, p: str) -> bool:\n    # Lengths of the string and the pattern\n    m, n = len(s), len(p)\n    \n    # DP table with (m+1) x (n+1) dimensions\n    dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    # Base case: empty string and empty pattern match\n    dp[0][0] = True\n    \n    # Base case: empty string but non-empty pattern with '*' that might match empty string\n    for j in range(2, n + 1):\n        if p[j - 1] == '*':\n            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 2]\n    \n    # Fill the table\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if p[j - 1] == '*':\n                # '*' can match zero of the preceding element\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 2] or (\n                    (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] or p[j - 2] == '.') and dp[i - 1][j]\n                )\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = (s[i - 1] == p[j - 1] or p[j - 1] == '.') and dp[i - 1][j - 1]\n    \n    # The result is whether the entire string matches the entire pattern\n    return dp[m][n]\n\n# Example Usage\nprint(isMatch(\"aa\", \"a\"))  # Output: False\nprint(isMatch(\"aa\", \"a*\"))  # Output: True\nprint(isMatch(\"ab\", \".*\"))  # Output: True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Base Case Initialization:** The DP table is initialized such that `dp[0][0]` is `True` because an empty string matches an empty pattern. `dp[0][j]` for even `j` can be `True` if the pattern part is effectively emptying using `*` elements.\n- **Fill DP Table:** If the pattern character is `*`, it can either represent zero occurrences of its preceding character (hence we look two steps back in the pattern) or one/more occurrences of the preceding character (hence we look one step back in the string matching state). We also handle `.` as a wildcard for matching any single character.\n- **Result:** The cell `dp[m][n]` stores whether the full string `s` matches the full pattern `p`.\n\nThis DP solution efficiently checks match possibilities and is constrained within the input size limits.",

Base cases:\n   - Empty pattern matches empty string: `dp[0][0] = True`\n   - For patterns starting with '*', we need to check if skipping the '*' and its preceding character gives a match.\n\n3. For filling the DP table, we have three cases:\n   - If current characters match or pattern has '.': copy the result from diagonal up-left\n   - If pattern has '*':\n     * Try zero occurrence: check result by skipping '*' and its preceding character\n     * Try one or more occurrences: if preceding character matches current string character or is '.', check the result from one row up\n\n4. The final answer is in `dp[len(s)][len(p)]`\n\nExample usage:\n```python\n# Test cases\nprint(isMatch(\"aa\", \"a\"))     # False\nprint(isMatch(\"aa\", \"a*\"))    # True\nprint(isMatch(\"ab\", \".*\"))    # True\n```\n\nTime Complexity: O(m*n) where m and n are lengths of string and pattern respectively.\nSpace Complexity: O(m*n) for the DP table.\n\nKey points about the solution:\n1. It handles all cases including:\n   - Direct character matching\n   - '.' matching any character\n   - '*' matching zero or more occurrences\n   - Combinations of these patterns\n\n2. The solution is efficient as it uses dynamic programming to avoid recalculating the same subproblems.\n\n3. It handles edge cases like:\n   - Empty strings\n   - Patterns with consecutive '*'\n   - Patterns ending with '*'\n\n4. The solution satisfies all the given constraints and handles all test cases correctly.\n\nThis is one of the more challenging problems in string pattern matching, and the dynamic programming approach provides an elegant and efficient solution.",

        "response_B": "To merge the `k` sorted linked-lists into one sorted linked-list, you can use a variety of approaches. One of the most efficient ways to do this involves using a Min-Heap (priority queue). The basic idea is to take advantage of the fact that each of the linked lists is already sorted. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n### Approach: Min-Heap Priority Queue\n\n1. **Initialize a Min-Heap**: Create a min-heap (priority queue) to help efficiently extract the smallest element among the head nodes of the k linked lists.\n\n2. **Add Initial Nodes to the Heap**: Iterate over each linked-list and add the first node of each list (if it's not null) to the min-heap. The min-heap will ensure that the node with the smallest value can be extracted in constant time.\n\n3. **Merge Process**:\n   - Create a dummy node that serves as the start of the merged linked list.\n   - Use a pointer (`current`) to track the last node in the merged list.\n   - While the min-heap is not empty:\n     - Extract the node with the smallest value from the heap.\n     - Append this node to the merged list by setting `current.next` to this node.\n     - Move the `current` pointer to the node that was just added.\n     - If the extracted node has a next node, add the next node to the min-heap.\n\n4. **Return the Merged List**: The merged list will be connected following the dummy node, so return `dummy.next`.\n\nHere's a Python implementation demonstrating this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom heapq import heappush, heappop\n\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef mergeKLists(lists):\n    # Define a comparator for ListNode since Python's heapq does not support a custom comparator\n    ListNode.__lt__ = lambda self, other: self.val < other.val\n    \n    # Initialize the heap\n    min_heap = []\n    \n    # Add the head of each list to the heap\n    for node in lists:\n        if node:\n            heappush(min_heap, node)\n    \n    # Create a dummy node and a pointer to build the merged list\n    dummy = ListNode()\n    current = dummy\n    \n    # Merge the lists\n    while min_heap:\n        # Get the smallest ListNode from the heap\n        smallest_node = heappop(min_heap)\n        current.next = smallest_node\n        current = current.next\n        \n        # If there’s a next node, add it to the heap\n        if smallest_node.next:\n            heappush(min_heap, smallest_node.next)\n    \n    # Return the merged list, which is next to the dummy node\n    return dummy.next\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Min-Heap**: The min-heap is efficient for this problem because it dynamically maintains the smallest current head among the list heads.\n- **Complexity**: The time complexity is \\(O(N \\log k)\\), where \\(N\\) is the total number of nodes across all k lists. This is because each node insertion and extraction operation in the heap takes \\(O(\\log k)\\) and we perform this operation \\(N\\) times.\n- **Memory**: The auxiliary space complexity is \\(O(k)\\) due to the heap storage.",

        "response_A": "To solve the problem of reversing nodes in a linked list `k` at a time, we'll implement a function that iteratively reverses every group of `k` nodes in the list. If the number of nodes remaining is less than `k`, we'll leave them as is. Here's how we can implement this:\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef reverseKGroup(head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:\n    def reverseLinkedList(head, k):\n        prev = None\n        curr = head\n        while k > 0:\n            next_node = curr.next\n            curr.next = prev\n            prev = curr\n            curr = next_node\n            k -= 1\n        return prev  # New head after reversal\n\n    # Check the number of nodes in the list\n    count = 0\n    pointer = head\n    while pointer:\n        pointer = pointer.next\n        count += 1\n\n    # Sentinel node to handle head changes more easily\n    dummy = ListNode(0)\n    dummy.next = head\n    prev_group_end = dummy\n\n    while count >= k:\n        # Reverse the next k nodes\n        kth_node = prev_group_end\n        for _ in range(k):\n            kth_node = kth_node.next\n\n        next_group_start = kth_node.next\n        # Reverse k nodes\n        current_group_start = prev_group_end.next\n        kth_node.next = None\n        prev_group_end.next = reverseLinkedList(current_group_start, k)\n\n        # Connect the end of the reversed group to the start of the next group\n        current_group_start.next = next_group_start\n\n        # Move the pointer for previous group end\n        prev_group_end = current_group_start\n        count -= k\n\n    return dummy.next\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **ListNode Definition**: The `ListNode` class represents a node in a linked list.\n\n2. **reverseKGroup Function**:\n   - **reverseLinkedList**: This helper function reverses a linked list of a specific length `k` and returns the new head of the reversed list.\n   - **Counting Nodes**: It first counts the number of nodes in the list to determine if there are enough nodes left to form a complete group of `k` to reverse.\n   - **Dummy Node**: A dummy node is used to simplify edge cases, such as when reversing might affect the head of the list.\n   - **Iteration and Reversal**: Using a while loop, the function traverses the list and reverses nodes in groups of `k`. For each group:\n     - It locates the `k`th node from the current group start.\n     - Calls `reverseLinkedList` to reverse the group.\n     - Adjusts pointers to connect the reversed group with the rest of the list.\n   - **Remaining Nodes**: If the nodes remaining are less than `k` after completing some reversals, they remain unchanged.\n\nThis approach efficiently reverses nodes with `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list, and uses `O(1)` extra space. The algorithm directly manipulates the node references to perform in-place reversals.",
        "response_B": "Here's a solution to reverse nodes in k-groups in a linked list:\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef reverseKGroup(head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:\n    # Check if we have at least k nodes remaining\n    def hasKNodes(node, k):\n        count = 0\n        while node and count < k:\n            count += 1\n            node = node.next\n        return count == k\n    \n    # Base cases\n    if not head or k == 1:\n        return head\n    \n    # Check if we have at least k nodes\n    if not hasKNodes(head, k):\n        return head\n    \n    # Reverse k nodes\n    curr = head\n    prev = None\n    next_node = None\n    count = 0\n    \n    while curr and count < k:\n        next_node = curr.next\n        curr.next = prev\n        prev = curr\n        curr = next_node\n        count += 1\n    \n    # After reversing, 'prev' is the new head of this k-group\n    # 'curr' is the start of next k-group\n    # 'head' is now the tail of current k-group\n    \n    # Recursively reverse next k-group\n    head.next = reverseKGroup(curr, k)\n    \n    return prev\n\n# Helper function to create linked list from array\ndef createLinkedList(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return None\n    head = ListNode(arr[0])\n    curr = head\n    for val in arr[1:]:\n        curr.next = ListNode(val)\n        curr = curr.next\n    return head\n\n# Helper function to convert linked list to array\ndef linkedListToArray(head):\n    result = []\n    curr = head\n    while curr:\n        result.append(curr.val)\n        curr = curr.next\n    return result\n\n# Test the solution\ndef test():\n    # Test case 1\n    head1 = createLinkedList([1,2,3,4,5])\n    result1 = reverseKGroup(head1, 2)\n    print(linkedListToArray(result1))  # Should print [2,1,4,3,5]\n    \n    # Test case 2\n    head2 = createLinkedList([1,2,3,4,5])\n    result2 = reverseKGroup(head2, 3)\n    print(linkedListToArray(result2))  # Should print [3,2,1,4,5]\n\ntest()\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. First, we define a helper function `hasKNodes` that checks if there are at least k nodes remaining in the list from a given node.\n\n2. The main function `reverseKGroup` works recursively:\n   - If the list is empty or k=1, return the head as is\n   - If there are fewer than k nodes remaining, return the head as is\n   - Otherwise:\n     - Reverse k nodes\n     - Recursively reverse the rest of the list in k-groups\n     - Connect the reversed parts\n\n3. The actual reversal process:\n   - Uses three pointers (prev, curr, next) to reverse k nodes\n   - After reversing k nodes:\n     - prev becomes the new head of the k-group\n     - curr points to the start of next k-group\n     - The original head becomes the tail of the k-group\n\nTime Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list\nSpace Complexity: O(n/k) for recursion stack, where n is the number of nodes and k is the group size\n\nThe solution satisfies all the requirements:\n- It reverses the nodes in groups of k\n- If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k, it leaves the remaining nodes as is\n- It only changes the links between nodes, not the values\n- It handles all the given constraints\n\nFor the follow-up question about O(1) extra space, we can modify this solution to use an iterative approach instead of recursion. The core logic would remain the same, but we would use a dummy head node and iterate through the list, reversing k nodes at a time.",

        "response_B": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest continuous substring of well-formed parentheses. Well-formed parentheses mean that each opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')' and they are properly closed.\n\nWe can solve this problem using two primary methods: dynamic programming or using a stack. Here, I will describe the stack-based approach, which is both intuitive and efficient.\n\n### Stack-Based Approach\n\nThe idea is to use a stack to keep track of the indices of the characters. It'll help in finding the longest valid parentheses by considering indices of parentheses that are not matched.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. **Initialize a stack**: Start by pushing -1 onto the stack. This acts as a base index for when we find a valid substring at the start.\n   \n2. **Iterate through the string**:\n   - If the character is '(', push its index onto the stack.\n   - If the character is ')':\n     - Pop the top of the stack.\n     - If the stack becomes empty, push the current index onto the stack (as a new base).\n     - If the stack is not empty, calculate the length of the current valid substring by subtracting the current index from the top of the stack.\n\n3. **Track the maximum length**: During the iterations, keep track of the maximum length of valid parentheses found.\n\nThis algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity because each index is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.\n\nHere is the Python code implementing the stack-based approach:\n\n```python\ndef longestValidParentheses(s: str) -> int:\n    max_length = 0\n    stack = [-1]  # Initialize stack with base index for valid substrings\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        if char == '(':\n            stack.append(i)\n        else:\n            # Pop the last unmatched '('\n            stack.pop()\n            if not stack:\n                # If stack is empty, push current index as base for future valid substring\n                stack.append(i)\n            else:\n                # Calculate the length of the current valid substring\n                max_length = max(max_length, i - stack[-1])\n\n    return max_length\n```\n\nThis code will give you the length of the longest well-formed parentheses substring for any given input string `s`. You can test it with the examples provided:\n\n```python\n# Example 1\nprint(longestValidParentheses(\"(()\"))  # Output: 2\n\n# Example 2\nprint(longestValidParentheses(\")()())\"))  # Output: 4\n\n# Example 3\nprint(longestValidParentheses(\"\"))  # Output: 0\n```\n\nThis solution handles all edge cases, including strings starting or ending with unmatched parentheses, and empty strings.",

The backtracking algorithm works as follows:\n   - Find an empty cell\n   - If there are no empty cells, the puzzle is solved\n   - For the empty cell, try numbers from 1 to 9\n   - For each number, check if it's valid to place it\n   - If valid, place the number and recursively try to solve the rest of the puzzle\n   - If the recursive call returns True, we've found a solution\n   - If the recursive call returns False, we undo the current placement and try the next number\n   - If no number works, we return False to trigger backtracking\n\n4. The solution is guaranteed to work because:\n   - It tries all possible valid combinations\n   - The input is guaranteed to have exactly one solution\n   - The backtracking ensures we don't miss any possibilities\n\nTime Complexity: O(9^(n*n)) in the worst case, where n is the size of the board (9 in this case)\nSpace Complexity: O(n*n) for the recursion stack\n\nThe solution modifies the input board in-place and returns the solved board. Each cell in the output contains a digit from 1-9 that satisfies all Sudoku rules.",

        "response_A": "To solve the problem of finding the smallest missing positive integer from an unsorted integer array `nums`, we need to implement a solution with `O(n)` time complexity that also uses constant extra space. Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation and the corresponding algorithm:\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - We are interested in the smallest missing positive integer.\n   - Positive integers start from `1`.\n\n2. **Constraints and Observations**:\n   - The smallest possible missing positive integer must be within the range `[1, len(nums) + 1]`. This is because:\n     - If all numbers `1` to `n` (where `n` is the length of the array) are present, then the smallest missing positive would be `n + 1`.\n     - If any number within `1` to `n` is missing, that becomes the answer.\n\n3. **Algorithm Overview**:\n   - We will use the input array as a hash table of sorts to track presence of numbers by trying to place each number in its \"correct\" index position (`num - 1`).\n   - Any number that is less than `1` or greater than `n` is ignored during placement, as they can't be the smallest missing positive.\n   - After rearranging, the first position `i` where `nums[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, `i + 1` is the smallest missing integer.\n\n4. **Steps**:\n   - Traverse the array and move each number (let’s say `nums[i]`) to its corresponding position (`nums[nums[i] - 1]`), only if it is a valid positive number and not already in the right position.\n   - After the rearrangement, scan the array again to find the first index `i` such that `nums[i]` is not `i + 1`, at which point `i + 1` is the answer.\n   - If all positions are correct, then the missing number is `n + 1`.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\ndef firstMissingPositive(nums):\n    n = len(nums)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        # Place nums[i] at its correct position if nums[i] is in the range [1, n]\n        while 1 <= nums[i] <= n and nums[nums[i] - 1] != nums[i]:\n            # Swap nums[i] with nums[nums[i] - 1]\n            correct_index = nums[i] - 1\n            nums[i], nums[correct_index] = nums[correct_index], nums[i]\n    \n    # Scan through the list to find the first missing positive\n    for i in range(n):\n        if nums[i] != i + 1:\n            return i + 1\n    \n    # If not found, the missing number is n + 1\n    return n + 1\n\n# Examples to test the function\nprint(firstMissingPositive([1, 2, 0]))    # Output: 3\nprint(firstMissingPositive([3, 4, -1, 1])) # Output: 2\nprint(firstMissingPositive([7, 8, 9, 11, 12])) # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n- **Placement Logic**: We use a while loop to ensure each number `nums[i]` is placed at its correct index `nums[i] - 1`, provided it falls within a valid range.\n- **Final Scan**: A single pass through the list checks which is the first index `i` such that `nums[i]` is not `i + 1`. This gives the missing positive integer.\n- **Edge Handling**: If all numbers are in their places, then `n + 1` is the missing positive integer, since `1` through `n` are all present.",
        "response_B": "Here's a solution to find the smallest missing positive integer in an array with O(n) time complexity and constant extra space:\n\n```python\ndef firstMissingPositive(nums):\n    n = len(nums)\n    \n    # Step 1: Modify the array to handle negative numbers and zeros\n    # Replace negative numbers and zeros with n+1 (which is out of valid range)\n    for i in range(n):\n        if nums[i] <= 0:\n            nums[i] = n + 1\n    \n    # Step 2: Mark the presence of each number in the array\n    # For each number x in the array, mark nums[x-1] as negative\n    for i in range(n):\n        num = abs(nums[i])\n        if num <= n:\n            nums[num-1] = -abs(nums[num-1])\n    \n    # Step 3: Find the first positive number\n    # The first positive number's index + 1 is our answer\n    for i in range(n):\n        if nums[i] > 0:\n            return i + 1\n    \n    # If all numbers from 1 to n are present, return n+1\n    return n + 1\n```\n\nLet's understand how this solution works:\n\n1. First, we replace all negative numbers and zeros with n+1 (which is greater than the array size). This ensures we only deal with positive numbers.\n\n2. Then, for each number x in the array, we mark its presence by making the number at index (x-1) negative. We use abs() when accessing the number because it might have been marked negative in a previous iteration.\n\n3. Finally, we scan the array for the first positive number. The index of the first positive number plus 1 is our answer.\n\n4. If we don't find any positive numbers, it means all numbers from 1 to n are present, so we return n+1.\n\nTime Complexity: O(n) as we only traverse the array three times.\nSpace Complexity: O(1) as we modify the input array in-place.\n\nExample walkthrough:\n```\nnums = [3,4,-1,1]\n\nStep 1: Replace negatives and zeros\nnums = [3,4,5,1]\n\nStep 2: Mark presence\nFor 3: Mark index 2 negative -> [3,4,-5,1]\nFor 4: Mark index 3 negative -> [3,4,-5,-1]\nFor 5: Out of range, skip\nFor 1: Mark index 0 negative -> [-3,4,-5,-1]\n\nStep 3: Find first positive\nnums = [-3,4,-5,-1]\nIndex 1 has positive number, so return 2\n```\n\nThe answer is 2 because it's the smallest positive integer that's missing from the array.\n\nThis solution satisfies all the constraints:\n- It runs in O(n) time\n- Uses constant extra space\n- Works for all array sizes within the constraints\n- Handles all possible integer values in the input",

At each step:\n   - If left_max is smaller than right_max, we process the left side\n   - Otherwise, we process the right side\n   - The water trapped at current position is the difference between the maximum height (left_max or right_max) and current height\n\nTime Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the height array\nSpace Complexity: O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space\n\nExample walkthrough:\n```\nheight = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]\n\nInitial state:\nleft = 0, right = 11\nleft_max = 0, right_max = 0\n\nAs we process:\n1. Update maximums and calculate water at each step\n2. Move pointers based on which maximum is smaller\n3. Continue until pointers meet\n\nThe final result will be 6 units of water.\n```\n\nThe solution handles all the test cases and constraints mentioned in the problem:\n- Works for arrays of length 1 to 2*10^4\n- Works with heights from 0 to 10^5\n- Handles empty arrays by returning 0",

        "response_B": "To solve the problem of wildcard pattern matching with support for `'?'` and `'*'`, we can use dynamic programming. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:\n\n### Dynamic Programming Approach\n\nWe will create a 2D DP table, where `dp[i][j]` will represent whether the first `i` characters of the input string `s` can be matched by the first `j` characters of the pattern `p`.\n\n#### Steps to implement the solution:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `dp[0][0]` should be `true` because an empty pattern matches an empty string.\n   - Fill the first row, `dp[0][j]`, where `j >= 1`. A pattern starting with a `'*'` can match an empty string. Thus, if all preceding characters of the pattern are also `'*'`, `dp[0][j]` will be `true`.\n\n2. **DP Table Filling**:\n   - Iterate over each character in the string `s` and pattern `p`.\n   - For each `dp[i][j]`:\n     - If `p[j-1]` is a `'*'`, two scenarios:\n       - `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]` (Treat `'*'` as an empty sequence).\n       - `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]` (Treat `'*'` as matching one or more characters of the string `s`).\n     - If `p[j-1]` is a `'?'` or matches `s[i-1]`, we have:\n       - `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` (Move diagonally in the DP table).\n\n3. **Final Output**:\n   - The value in `dp[s.length][p.length]` will determine if the string `s` can be completely matched by the pattern `p`.\n\nHere is the Python implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python\ndef isMatch(s: str, p: str) -> bool:\n    # Define a DP table with dimensions (len(s) + 1) x (len(p) + 1)\n    dp = [[False] * (len(p) + 1) for _ in range(len(s) + 1)]\n    \n    # Base-case initialization, matching empty pattern and empty string\n    dp[0][0] = True\n\n    # Fill dp[0][j] for patterns like \"*\", \"**\", etc.\n    for j in range(1, len(p) + 1):\n        if p[j - 1] == '*':\n            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1]\n\n    # Start filling the rest of the table\n    for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):\n        for j in range(1, len(p) + 1):\n            if p[j - 1] == '?':\n                # '?' can match any single character\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]\n            elif p[j - 1] == '*':\n                # '*' can match an empty sequence or any single sequence\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] or dp[i - 1][j]\n            else:\n                # Match current characters of s and p\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] and s[i - 1] == p[j - 1]\n\n    return dp[len(s)][len(p)]\n\n# Example usage\nprint(isMatch(\"aa\", \"a\"))    # Output: False\nprint(isMatch(\"aa\", \"*\"))    # Output: True\nprint(isMatch(\"cb\", \"?a\"))   # Output: False\n```\n\n### Considerations:\n- This solution efficiently computes the match by utilizing the properties of dynamic programming and handles all edge cases like empty strings, multiple consecutive `'*'`s, and various combinations of regular characters and wildcards. \n\nThis code should match the entire input string to the pattern correctly according to the given rules for wildcards.",

This avoids placing a new queen that conflicts with existing queens.\n   \n2. **Recursive Backtracking**: The `backtrack` function attempts to place queens row by row starting from row 0. For each row, it tries placing a queen in each column. If the position is safe (not under attack from another queen diagonally or vertically), it places the queen and proceeds to solve for the next row.\n\n3. **Base Case**: If you reach the `n`-th row, it means you have successfully placed all queens without conflict, hence found a valid solution, and you return 1 to count this arrangement.\n\n4. **Backtracking**: If placing a queen leads to a conflict, you remove the queen and try the next available position in the current row, effectively exploring all attempts.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the distinct solutions on a chessboard for `n` ranging from 1 to 9.",

        "response_B": "Let me help you solve this step by step.\n\nThe key insight is that we can find each digit of the kth permutation without generating all permutations. Here's how:\n\n1. For n numbers, there are n! permutations\n2. For the first position, there are (n-1)! permutations starting with each digit\n3. We can use this to find which digit comes first, then repeat for remaining positions\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n```python\ndef getPermutation(n: int, k: int) -> str:\n    # Create list of numbers from 1 to n\n    numbers = list(range(1, n + 1))\n    \n    # Adjust k to 0-based index\n    k = k - 1\n    \n    # Initialize result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Calculate factorial of (n-1)\n    factorial = 1\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        factorial *= i\n    \n    # Find each digit of the permutation\n    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        # Find the index of the current digit\n        index = k // factorial\n        k = k % factorial\n        \n        # Add the digit to result and remove it from numbers\n        result.append(str(numbers[index]))\n        numbers.pop(index)\n        \n        # Update factorial for next iteration\n        factorial = factorial // i\n    \n    # Add the last remaining number\n    result.append(str(numbers[0]))\n    \n    # Join the digits and return\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nLet's go through how it works:\n\n1. First, we create a list of numbers from 1 to n.\n\n2. We adjust k to be 0-based (since we're working with array indices).\n\n3. For each position:\n   - Calculate how many permutations start with each remaining digit (factorial)\n   - Use integer division to find which digit goes in the current position\n   - Update k to what remains after accounting for previous digits\n   - Add the chosen digit to the result and remove it from available numbers\n   - Update factorial for the next iteration\n\nFor example, with n=3, k=3:\n- Initially, factorial = 2 (2!)\n- For first position: 3//2 = 1, so we take numbers[1] = 2\n- k becomes 3%2 = 1\n- For second position: factorial = 1\n- 1//1 = 1, so we take the second remaining number (3)\n- k becomes 1%1 = 0\n- Last position: take the remaining number (1)\n- Result: \"213\"\n\nTime Complexity: O(n)\nSpace Complexity: O(n)\n\nThe solution works for all the example cases:\n```python\nprint(getPermutation(3, 3))  # \"213\"\nprint(getPermutation(4, 9))  # \"2314\"\nprint(getPermutation(3, 1))  # \"123\"\n```\n\nThis approach is much more efficient than generating all permutations and selecting the kth one, which would take O(n!) time.",

Then, start a new line with the current word.\n\n3. **Justification**: \n   - For a fully-justified line (not the last line):\n     - Calculate total spaces needed and distribute them between words as evenly as possible. Extra spaces should be added to the leftmost slots first.\n     - Special case: if there is only one word, left-justify it.\n   - For the last line or when the loop ends:\n     - Simply left-justify the line.

If a word can't be added, the current line is justified and added to the result.\n- **Justification**: Words are justified by lengthening the space between them. The `i % (len(current_line) - 1 or 1)` ensures that spaces are distributed even if there's only one word (preventing division by zero).\n- **Left-Justification for the Last Line**: The final line or any line with a single word is left-justified using the `ljust` method.\n\nThis function provides a complete solution to exhaustively pack and justify lines according to the problem's requirements.",

        "response_A": "To solve the problem of finding the minimum window substring in `s` that contains all characters of `t`, we can use the Sliding Window technique along with a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Character Frequency Count**: \n   - First, we need to count the occurrences of each character in `t` using a hash map (or dictionary). This will allow us to know what characters and how many of each we need to find in any potential window in `s`.\n\n2. **Initialize Pointers and Variables**:\n   - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, initially set to the start of `s`. These pointers help define the current window of characters being considered in `s`.\n   - Keep a variable `matched` to track how many characters in `t` are sufficiently matched in the current window.\n   - Another hash map (like the one for `t`) to keep track of the current window's character counts.\n\n3. **Expand and Contract the Window**:\n   - **Expand**: Start increasing the `right` pointer to expand the window by including new characters. Update the current window's character count. If a newly included character from `s` matches the requirement (in terms of count) in `t`, increase the `matched` count.\n   - **Contract**: Once all the characters are sufficiently matched, try to shrink the window from the left by moving the `left` pointer to see if a smaller valid window can be found. Only shrink if the current window satisfies the requirement.\n\n4. **Update the Result**:\n   - Each time a valid window satisfying all characters of `t` is found, compare its length with the current minimum length found. If it is smaller, update the result substrings and the minimum length.\n\n5. **Time Complexity**:\n   - The algorithm primarily moves each pointer over `s` at most once, which gives it a linear time complexity of `O(m + n)`, where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `t`.\n\nHere is the Python code implementing this solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef minWindow(s: str, t: str) -> str:\n    if not s or not t:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    dict_t = Counter(t)\n    required = len(dict_t)\n    \n    left, right = 0, 0\n    formed = 0\n    window_counts = {}\n    \n    # (window length, left, right)\n    ans = float(\"inf\"), None, None\n    \n    while right < len(s):\n        character = s[right]\n        window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1\n        \n        if character in dict_t and window_counts[character] == dict_t[character]:\n            formed += 1\n        \n        while left <= right and formed == required:\n            character = s[left]\n            \n            # Save the smallest window until now.\n            if right - left + 1 < ans[0]:\n                ans = (right - left + 1, left, right)\n            \n            window_counts[character] -= 1\n            if character in dict_t and window_counts[character] < dict_t[character]:\n                formed -= 1\n            \n            left += 1\n        \n        # Expand the window by moving the right pointer.\n        right += 1\n    \n    return \"\" if ans[0] == float(\"inf\") else s[ans[1]:ans[2] + 1]\n\n# Test the function with provided examples:\nprint(minWindow(\"ADOBECODEBANC\", \"ABC\"))  # Output: \"BANC\"\nprint(minWindow(\"a\", \"a\"))                # Output: \"a\"\nprint(minWindow(\"a\", \"aa\"))               # Output: \"\"\n```\n\nThis implementation efficiently finds the minimum window in `s` that contains all characters of `t` by using a sliding window approach.",

First, we create a dictionary `t_count` to store the frequency of each character in string t.\n\n2. We maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, to define our window.\n\n3. We use two dictionaries:\n   - `t_count`: stores required character frequencies from t\n   - `window_counts`: stores current character frequencies in our window\n\n4. We also track:\n   - `required`: number of unique characters needed from t\n   - `formed`: number of unique characters that have met their required frequency in current window\n\n5. The algorithm:\n   - Expand window by moving right pointer\n   - When we have all required characters (formed == required):\n     - Try to contract window from left\n     - Update answer if current window is smaller\n   - Continue until we process all characters\n\nTime Complexity: O(m + n) where:\n- m is length of string s\n- n is length of string t\n\nSpace Complexity: O(k) where k is the number of unique characters in strings s and t.\n\nThe solution handles all the example cases:\n\n```python\n# Example 1\nprint(minWindow(\"ADOBECODEBANC\", \"ABC\"))  # Output: \"BANC\"\n\n# Example 2\nprint(minWindow(\"a\", \"a\"))  # Output: \"a\"\n\n# Example 3\nprint(minWindow(\"a\", \"aa\"))  # Output: \"\"\n```\n\nThe algorithm is optimal and meets the follow-up requirement of O(m + n) time complexity. It uses the sliding window technique to avoid checking all possible substrings, and only processes each character a constant number of times.",

The width of this rectangle is determined by the current index and the new top of the stack.\n\n4. **Final Cleanup**: After iterating through the histogram, any remaining bars in the stack are handled by popping and calculating areas as above, considering the rest of the histogram to the right.\n\nThis approach effectively finds the maximum area of any rectangle in the histogram using only a single pass with auxiliary stack data of a minimal footprint.",

The solution uses dynamic programming with memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblems.\n\nTime Complexity: O(n^4) where n is the length of the strings. For each recursive call, we try n-1 different splits, and for each split, we make two recursive calls.\nSpace Complexity: O(n^3) for the memoization dictionary.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\n# Example 1\nprint(isScramble(\"great\", \"rgeat\"))  # Output: True\n\n# Example 2\nprint(isScramble(\"abcde\", \"caebd\"))  # Output: False\n\n# Example 3\nprint(isScramble(\"a\", \"a\"))  # Output: True\n```\n\nThe solution handles all the test cases correctly and efficiently using memoization to avoid redundant computations.",

Hence, initialize `dp[i][0]` to 1 for all valid `i`.\n   - `dp[0][j]` for any `j > 0` should be 0, since an empty string `s` cannot form any non-empty subsequence `t`.\n\n2. **Filling the DP Table**:\n   - Iterate through each character of `s` (from `1` to `m`) and each character of `t` (from `1` to `n`).\n   - For each pair of indices `(i, j)`, consider if `s[i-1] == t[j-1]`:\n     - If `s[i-1] == t[j-1]`, the number of distinct subsequences can be derived by either:\n       - Including `s[i-1]` as part of the subsequence for `t[0..j-1]` which contributes `dp[i-1][j-1]`.\n       - Excluding `s[i-1]` and relying on previous subsequences up to `i-1`, which contributes `dp[i-1][j]`.\n     - If `s[i-1] != t[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j]` would be the value of `dp[i-1][j]`, because `s[i-1]` cannot be part of any subsequence matching `t[0..j-1]`.\n\n3. **Result Extraction**:\n   - The number of distinct subsequences of `s` that forms `t` would be in `dp[m][n]`, where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `t`.\n\nBelow is the Python code that implements this dynamic programming approach:\n\n```python\ndef numDistinct(s: str, t: str) -> int:\n    m, n = len(s), len(t)\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n\n    # An empty string t can always be formed by any prefix of s by taking empty subsequence.\n    for i in range(m + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = 1\n\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if s[i-1] == t[j-1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]\n\n    return dp[m][n]\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(numDistinct(\"rabbbit\", \"rabbit\"))  # Output: 3\nprint(numDistinct(\"babgbag\", \"bag\"))     # Output: 5\n```\n\nThis `numDistinct` function will return the correct number of distinct subsequences for any given strings `s` and `t` within the constraints provided.",

The approach involves creating helper arrays to track the potential profits from each transaction at each day.

        "response_B": "To tackle the problem of finding the maximum path sum in a binary tree, we need to use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The idea is to recursively traverse through each node of the tree, calculating the maximum path sum that can be obtained by including the current node and its subtrees. Here is a step-by-step explanation and solution to implement this:\n\n1. **Define the Recursive Function:**\n   We'll create a helper function that returns the maximum path sum from the subtree rooted at the current node, considering paths that can start and end at any node below it.\n\n2. **Calculate the Maximum Path Sum:**\n   While visiting each node, compute two key values:\n   - The maximum path sum **including** the node and possibly going through its left and right children (this path may form a part of bigger paths).\n   - The maximum path sum **starting** at the current node and going down to either its left or right child, reflecting the best path going upwards to potentially connect to parent paths.\n\n3. **Update the Global Maximum:**\n   During the DFS traversal, update a global variable that keeps track of the highest path sum encountered so far. This is done by considering all possible maximum path sums that include the current node and its left and right subtrees.\n\n4. **Consider Base Cases:**\n   If we encounter a null (leaf's child), return 0, since a null node contributes nothing to the path sum.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   Handle edge cases such as negative node values – it might be beneficial to not include them in the path.\n\nHere's the Python implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef maxPathSum(root: TreeNode) -> int:\n    def dfs(node: TreeNode) -> int:\n        if not node:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Compute the path sum that includes the left child\n        left_max = max(dfs(node.left), 0)\n        # Compute the path sum that includes the right child\n        right_max = max(dfs(node.right), 0)\n        \n        # Current path sum including both children and the node itself\n        current_path_sum = node.val + left_max + right_max\n        \n        # Update the global maximum path sum\n        nonlocal max_sum\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_path_sum)\n        \n        # Return the maximum path sum including the current node and one subtree\n        return node.val + max(left_max, right_max)\n    \n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    dfs(root)\n    return max_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **dfs(node):** It computes the maximum path sum where the path can end at this node and returns the maximum sum of a path continuing upwards through either subtree.\n- **max_sum:** A global variable that keeps track of the best path sum seen so far across any path in the binary tree.\n- The **base case:** If `node` is `None`, return 0, which means it contributes nothing to a path sum.\n- In each recursion, the current node's value combines with the best sub-paths possible from both children. We update `max_sum` to ensure that we record the highest possible path sum.\n\nThis solution effectively traverses the tree with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes, since it visits each node once. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. This handles both balanced and skewed trees well.",

This is a crucial step because it determines possible transformations.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:\n   - Use BFS to find the shortest transformation path length from `beginWord` to `endWord`.\n   - While traversing, use a queue to track the current path and a set to store visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Keep track of the shortest path level and ensure no further exploration once that level is reached beyond the shortest path.\n\n4. **Backtracking**:\n   - After BFS, use backtracking to explore all possible paths of length equal to the shortest path length found via BFS.\n   - Start from `beginWord` and construct all shortest paths reaching `endWord` using the adjacency list created earlier.\n\nBelow is a Python implementation of this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef findLadders(beginWord, endWord, wordList):\n    if endWord not in wordList:\n        return []\n    \n    # Create an adjacency list where each word is a node and can connect to words differing by one letter\n    wordList = set(wordList)\n    wordList.add(beginWord)\n    adj = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    def connectWords(w1, w2):\n        diff = sum([1 for c1, c2 in zip(w1, w2) if c1 != c2])\n        return diff == 1\n    \n    for word in wordList:\n        for other_word in wordList:\n            if connectWords(word, other_word):\n                adj[word].append(other_word)\n    \n    # Breadth-First Search to find the shortest path length\n    queue = deque([[beginWord]])\n    visited = set([beginWord])\n    found = False\n    shortest = float('inf')\n    results = []\n    \n    while queue and not found:\n        level_visited = set()\n        for _ in range(len(queue)):\n            path = queue.popleft()\n            current_word = path[-1]\n            \n            if len(path) > shortest:\n                break\n            \n            for neighbor in adj[current_word]:\n                if neighbor == endWord:\n                    found = True\n                    shortest = len(path)\n                    results.append(path + [endWord])\n                \n                if neighbor not in visited:\n                    level_visited.add(neighbor)\n                    queue.append(path + [neighbor])\n        \n        visited.update(level_visited)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Test cases\nbeginWord1 = \"hit\"\nendWord1 = \"cog\"\nwordList1 = [\"hot\", \"dot\", \"dog\", \"lot\", \"log\", \"cog\"]\nprint(findLadders(beginWord1, endWord1, wordList1))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Adjacency List**: We construct it based on the rule that words can connect if they differ by one letter.\n2. **BFS**: Searches all possible transformations level by level and maintains a path of transformations. Stop further BFS exploration when the shortest path level is exceeded.\n3. **Result Construction**: Paths are recorded only if they match the shortest transformation length.",

        "response_A": "To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the shortest transformation sequence from the `beginWord` to the `endWord`. BFS is appropriate here because it explores all nodes at the present \"depth\" level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which helps in finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this where each transformation is considered to be of equal \"weight.\"\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Check if `endWord` is in `wordList`:** If `endWord` is not present in the provided `wordList`, then it's impossible to reach it, and we can immediately return `0`.\n\n2. **Initialize BFS:** Use a queue to implement BFS. Start with a queue that contains a tuple of the `beginWord` and the initial transformation length of `1` (since `beginWord` is the first word in the transformation sequence).\n\n3. **Word Set:** Convert the `wordList` into a set for O(1) look-ups. It will also allow removing words once they are visited, a common BFS optimization that prevents cycles and redundant work.\n\n4. **BFS Loop:** \n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue the front element, which gives you the current word and the current transformation length.\n   - Try changing each character in the current word to every possible lowercase English letter. For each new word:\n     - If the new word is the `endWord`, return the current transformation length + 1 since you've reached the end.\n     - If the new word is in the word set, add it to the queue with an incremented transformation length, and then remove it from the set to mark as visited.\n\n5. **Return:** If you exhaust the queue without finding the `endWord`, return `0`, meaning no transformation sequence exists.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList):\n    wordSet = set(wordList)\n    \n    # Early exit if endWord is not in wordList\n    if endWord not in wordSet:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Setup BFS\n    queue = deque([(beginWord, 1)])\n    \n    # BFS\n    while queue:\n        currentWord, length = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Try changing each letter to find all potential transformations\n        for i in range(len(currentWord)):\n            # Try every lowercase letter\n            for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n                if currentWord[i] != c:  # Avoid replacing the letter with itself\n                    nextWord = currentWord[:i] + c + currentWord[i+1:]\n                    \n                    # Check if it's the end word\n                    if nextWord == endWord:\n                        return length + 1\n                    \n                    # If the word is a valid transformation and is in the set\n                    if nextWord in wordSet:\n                        queue.append((nextWord, length + 1))\n                        wordSet.remove(nextWord)  # Mark visited\n    \n    # If we exit the while loop without having found a sequence\n    return 0\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the shortest path using transformations, leveraging BFS's level-order traversal nature to ensure the shortest path is found first.",

First, we check if the endWord is in wordList. If not, return 0 as no transformation is possible.\n\n2. We convert the wordList to a set for O(1) lookup time.\n\n3. We use BFS with a queue that stores tuples of (word, level), where level represents the number of transformations so far.\n\n4. For each word in the queue:\n   - We try changing each character position\n   - For each position, we try all 26 lowercase letters\n   - For each new word formed:\n     * If it equals endWord, we return the current level + 1\n     * If it exists in wordSet and hasn't been visited, we add it to the queue\n\n5. If we can't reach endWord, return 0\n\nTime Complexity: O(N * 26 * L) where:\n- N is the length of each word\n- 26 is the number of possible characters\n- L is the length of wordList\n\nSpace Complexity: O(N) for the queue and visited set.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\n# Example 1\nbeginWord = \"hit\"\nendWord = \"cog\"\nwordList = [\"hot\",\"dot\",\"dog\",\"lot\",\"log\",\"cog\"]\nprint(ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList))  # Output: 5\n\n# Example 2\nbeginWord = \"hit\"\nendWord = \"cog\"\nwordList = [\"hot\",\"dot\",\"dog\",\"lot\",\"log\"]\nprint(ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList))  # Output: 0\n```\n\nThe solution efficiently finds the shortest transformation sequence by exploring all possible transformations level by level using BFS. This ensures that when we find the endWord, we've found it using the minimum number of transformations possible.",

This method achieves a time complexity better than a simple linear search but potentially worse than classical binary search due to duplicates.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation with a solution:\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Binary Search Approach:** \n   - Initiate two pointers: `left` at the start of the array and `right` at the end.\n   - Use a binary search pattern to narrow down the subarray where the minimum value resides.\n   - Calculate the middle index: `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.\n\n2. **Comparison Logic:**\n   - Compare `nums[mid]` with `nums[right]`:\n     - If `nums[mid] > nums[right]`, this means the minimum is in the right half of the array, so set `left = mid + 1`.\n     - If `nums[mid] < nums[right]`, this means the minimum could be at `mid` or in the left part, so set `right = mid`.\n     - If `nums[mid] == nums[right]`, due to duplicates, we cannot be sure which side contains the minimum. Thus, decrement `right` by one (`right -= 1`) to potentially skip a duplicate, reducing the search space gradually.\n\n3. **Stopping Condition:**\n   - The loop continues until `left` equals `right`. At that point, the minimum value is found at `nums[left]` or equivalently `nums[right]`.\n\n4. **Handling Duplicates:**\n   - The decision to move `right` when encountering duplicates (with `nums[mid] == nums[right]`) is crucial to handling these gracefully and helps maintain better-than-linear time complexity.\n   \n### Solution Code:\n```python\ndef findMin(nums):\n    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n    \n    while left < right:\n        mid = left + (right - left) // 2\n        \n        if nums[mid] > nums[right]:\n            # The minimum is in the right part\n            left = mid + 1\n        elif nums[mid] < nums[right]:\n            # The minimum could be the mid or is in the left part\n            right = mid\n        else:\n            # nums[mid] == nums[right], cannot be sure, reduce search space\n            right -= 1\n    \n    return nums[left]  # or nums[right], as left == right\n\n# Test cases\nprint(findMin([1, 3, 5]))  # Output: 1\nprint(findMin([2, 2, 2, 0, 1]))  # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Complexity Analysis:\n- The average time complexity remains approximately O(log n) in optimal scenarios for non-duplicate cases, but it potentially degrades to O(n) in the presence of many duplicates due to the linear decrement of `right`.\n- The space complexity is O(1) since no additional data structures are used beyond the input array.\n\nThis approach effectively narrows down the search for the minimum element while efficiently handling duplicates.",
        "response_B": "I'll help you solve this problem. The key difference from the regular rotated sorted array problem is that this array can contain duplicates, which requires special handling.\n\nHere's a solution using binary search:\n\n```python\ndef findMin(nums):\n    left = 0\n    right = len(nums) - 1\n    \n    while left < right:\n        mid = left + (right - left) // 2\n        \n        # If right element is greater than mid element,\n        # minimum must be in left half (including mid)\n        if nums[mid] < nums[right]:\n            right = mid\n        \n        # If right element is less than mid element,\n        # minimum must be in right half\n        elif nums[mid] > nums[right]:\n            left = mid + 1\n            \n        # If they're equal, we can't be sure which half,\n        # but we know right can't be the minimum (since mid is same),\n        # so we can reduce right by 1\n        else:\n            right -= 1\n            \n    return nums[left]\n```\n\nLet's go through how this works:\n\n1. We use binary search with two pointers: left and right.\n\n2. At each step, we compare the middle element with the rightmost element:\n   - If nums[mid] < nums[right]: The minimum must be in the left half (including mid)\n   - If nums[mid] > nums[right]: The minimum must be in the right half\n   - If nums[mid] == nums[right]: We can't determine which half, but we know right isn't the minimum\n\n3. The key difference from the non-duplicate version is the handling of the equal case. When nums[mid] == nums[right], we can't be sure which half contains the minimum, but we know that nums[right] can't be the minimum (since we have the same value at mid), so we can safely reduce right by 1.\n\nTime Complexity:\n- Average case: O(log n)\n- Worst case: O(n) when there are many duplicates (like [1,1,1,1,1])\n\nSpace Complexity: O(1)\n\nExample usage:\n```python\n# Example 1\nprint(findMin([1,3,5]))  # Output: 1\n\n# Example 2\nprint(findMin([2,2,2,0,1]))  # Output: 0\n\n# Example with duplicates\nprint(findMin([4,5,6,7,0,1,4]))  # Output: 0\n```\n\nRegarding the follow-up question:\nYes, duplicates affect the runtime complexity. In the regular version without duplicates, we can always eliminate half of the array in each step, guaranteeing O(log n) time. However, with duplicates, in the worst case (when many elements are the same), we might need to reduce the search space by only one element at a time, leading to O(n) time complexity.\n\nFor example, consider the array [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. When nums[mid] == nums[right], we can only reduce right by 1 since we can't determine which half contains the minimum.",

        "response_A": "Here's a solution to implement the read method that can handle multiple calls:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize buffer and pointers\n        self.buf4 = [''] * 4  # Internal buffer for read4\n        self.buf4_pos = 0     # Current position in buf4\n        self.buf4_count = 0   # Number of characters in buf4\n\n    def read(self, buf: List[str], n: int) -> int:\n        chars_read = 0  # Total characters read\n        \n        while chars_read < n:\n            # If we've used all characters in buf4, read more\n            if self.buf4_pos == self.buf4_count:\n                self.buf4_pos = 0  # Reset position\n                self.buf4_count = read4(self.buf4)  # Read new characters\n                \n                # If no more characters can be read, break\n                if self.buf4_count == 0:\n                    break\n            \n            # Copy characters from buf4 to buf\n            while chars_read < n and self.buf4_pos < self.buf4_count:\n                buf[chars_read] = self.buf4[self.buf4_pos]\n                chars_read += 1\n                self.buf4_pos += 1\n                \n        return chars_read\n```\n\nThis solution works by maintaining an internal buffer and state between multiple calls. Here's how it works:\n\n1. In the constructor, we initialize:\n   - `buf4`: An internal buffer of size 4 to store characters from read4\n   - `buf4_pos`: Current position in buf4\n   - `buf4_count`: Number of valid characters in buf4\n\n2. In the read method:\n   - We keep track of total characters read in `chars_read`\n   - We continue reading until we either:\n     - Read n characters\n     - Reach end of file\n\n3. The main logic:\n   - If we've used all characters in our internal buffer (buf4_pos == buf4_count):\n     - Reset position\n     - Call read4 to get new characters\n     - If read4 returns 0, we've reached EOF, so break\n   - Copy characters from our internal buffer to the output buffer\n   - Update positions and counters\n\n4. Finally, return the total number of characters read\n\nExample usage:\n```\nFor file = \"abc\", queries = [1,2,1]\n\nFirst call (n=1):\n- Reads \"abcd\" into buf4\n- Copies 'a' to buf\n- Returns 1\n\nSecond call (n=2):\n- Uses existing buf4 content\n- Copies 'b' and 'c' to buf\n- Returns 2\n\nThird call (n=1):\n- No more characters to read\n- Returns 0\n```\n\nTime Complexity:\n- O(n) for each read call, where n is the number of characters requested\n\nSpace Complexity:\n- O(1) as we only use a fixed-size buffer of 4 characters\n\nThe key to handling multiple calls is maintaining the state between calls using the class variables. This allows us to remember where we left off in the internal buffer and continue from there in subsequent calls.",
        "response_B": "To solve the problem of reading `n` characters from the file using the `read4` method, we need to handle the fact that `read` can be called multiple times and that `read4` reads always up to 4 characters at a time. We'll maintain state across multiple calls to `read` using a class with some internal buffers. Here's how we can structure our solution:\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. **Internal Buffering:**\n   We'll use an internal buffer to store characters read from the file but not yet processed by previous `read` calls. This will help when subsequent `read` calls need more characters from the file.\n\n2. **State Maintenance:**\n   We'll maintain an internal pointer (`internalIndex`) that keeps track of how many characters from the internal buffer have already been given to the user.\n\n3. **Handling Multiple Calls:**\n   The method should handle calls to `read` such that it utilizes leftover characters in the internal buffer before reading more from the file using `read4`.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nThe solution will involve maintaining:\n- `internalBuf`: A buffer to hold the characters read by `read4` that might not all be used in one `read` call.\n- `internalBufPtr`: A pointer for tracking the current position in `internalBuf`.\n- `internalBufCount`: Count of the valid data in `internalBuf`.\n\nLet's write the solution in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # A buffer to hold leftover data from read4\n        self.internalBuf = [''] * 4\n        # Count of characters in internalBuf\n        self.internalBufCount = 0\n        # Pointer to track current position in internalBuf\n        self.internalBufPtr = 0\n\n    def read(self, buf, n):\n        total = 0\n        # Start the loop to fill buf with n characters.\n        while total < n:\n            # Check if we have any remaining characters in internalBuf\n            if self.internalBufPtr < self.internalBufCount:\n                buf[total] = self.internalBuf[self.internalBufPtr]\n                total += 1\n                self.internalBufPtr += 1\n            else:\n                # Refill internalBuf using read4\n                self.internalBufCount = read4(self.internalBuf)\n                self.internalBufPtr = 0\n                # If read4 returns 0, means end of file is reached.\n                if self.internalBufCount == 0:\n                    break\n            \n        return total\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Internal Buffer (`internalBuf`):** Holds the characters from `read4` calls. It's fixed to 4 because `read4` reads up to 4 characters.\n  \n- **Control Flow:**\n  - Use characters from `internalBuf` until it's depleted.\n  - If `internalBuf` is exhausted, call `read4` to refill it.\n  - Repeat until either `n` characters have been read or the file ends (when `read4` returns less than 4 characters but is called again).\n\nThis solution efficiently leverages the `read4` method, manages leftover characters, and maintains state between multiple `read` calls, ensuring that consecutive calls to `read` get accurate results.",

If not, backtrack immediately.\n   - **Word Checking:** If the current path forms a complete word, add it to the result set.\n   - **Visited Marker:** Temporarily mark cells as visited to avoid revisiting during a path exploration.\n\n3. **Direction Exploration:** Consider exploring each cell in four directions - up, down, left, and right.\n\n4. **Backtracking:** After exploring from a cell, backtrack by unmarking it to explore new paths starting from different cells.\n\n5. **Result Collection:** Use a set to prevent duplicate entries and collect all distinct words found on the board.\n\nBelow is the implementation of the described approach in Python:\n\n```python\nclass TrieNode:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = {}\n        self.is_end_of_word = False\n\nclass Trie:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.root = TrieNode()\n\n    def insert(self, word):\n        node = self.root\n        for letter in word:\n            if letter not in node.children:\n                node.children[letter] = TrieNode()\n            node = node.children[letter]\n        node.is_end_of_word = True\n\nclass Solution:\n    def findWords(self, board, words):\n        def dfs(node, x, y, path):\n            if node.is_end_of_word:\n                # Add the found word to results\n                result.add(path)\n                # To prevent duplicate paths exploration\n                node.is_end_of_word = False\n\n            if x < 0 or x >= len(board) or y < 0 or y >= len(board[0]) or board[x][y] == \"#\":\n                return\n            \n            tmp = board[x][y]\n            node = node.children.get(tmp)\n            \n            # Prune the search space if no such prefix\n            if node is None:\n                return\n\n            # Mark the board cell as visited\n            board[x][y] = \"#\"\n\n            # Explore all four directions\n            dfs(node, x + 1, y, path + tmp)\n            dfs(node, x - 1, y, path + tmp)\n            dfs(node, x, y + 1, path + tmp)\n            dfs(node, x, y - 1, path + tmp)\n\n            # Backtrack\n            board[x][y] = tmp\n\n        # Create a trie for all the words\n        trie = Trie()\n        for word in words:\n            trie.insert(word)\n\n        result = set()\n        for i in range(len(board)):\n            for j in range(len(board[0])):\n                dfs(trie.root, i, j, \"\")\n        \n        return list(result)\n\n# Example Usage:\n# board = [[\"o\",\"a\",\"a\",\"n\"],[\"e\",\"t\",\"a\",\"e\"],[\"i\",\"h\",\"k\",\"r\"],[\"i\",\"f\",\"l\",\"v\"]]\n# words = [\"oath\", \"pea\", \"eat\", \"rain\"]\n# solution = Solution()\n# print(solution.findWords(board, words))  # Output: [\"oath\", \"eat\"]\n```\n\nIn this solution, we efficiently search through potential word paths on the board while leveraging the trie to quickly rule out non-promising paths. The use of a set ensures we collect unique words only, and the DFS explores each possible letter sequence on the board once, improving performance.",

        "response_A": "To solve the problem of finding the shortest palindrome by adding characters to the front of the given string `s`, we can use a clever approach involving string manipulation and the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for computing prefix tables. This method efficiently determines how much of the string is already a palindrome from the start and thus how many characters we need to prepend.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Reversed String Concatenation**: \n   - First, we create a new string by concatenating the original string `s` with a special character (not present in the string, e.g., `#`) and its reverse, i.e., `s + '#' + reverse(s)`. This helps us in applying the KMP algorithm to find the longest prefix which is also a suffix (palindrome in this context).\n\n2. **KMP Prefix Table**:\n   - Compute the prefix table (also known as prefix function or pi array) for the concatenated string. This table helps find the longest border (prefix which is also a suffix) for any prefix of the string.\n   - The value at the last position of this prefix table gives the length of the longest palindromic prefix of `s`.\n\n3. **Construct the Result**:\n   - The characters after this longest palindromic prefix in `s` are those that need to be added in front of `s` in reverse order to form the shortest palindrome.\n   - Construct the resulting palindrome by prepending the reverse of the suffix (the part of the string not in the palindromic prefix) to the original string `s`.\n\nHere is a Python implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python\ndef shortestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:\n    if not s:\n        return s\n    \n    # Create the concatenated string with a special character in between\n    l = s + \"#\" + s[::-1]\n    \n    # Compute the prefix table for this concatenated string\n    n = len(l)\n    prefix = [0] * n\n    \n    # KMP algorithm to fill the prefix table\n    j = 0  # length of previous longest prefix suffix\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        while j > 0 and l[i] != l[j]:\n            j = prefix[j - 1]\n        \n        if l[i] == l[j]:\n            j += 1\n        \n        prefix[i] = j\n    \n    # The length of the longest palindromic prefix in `s`\n    longest_palindromic_prefix_length = prefix[-1]\n    \n    # The suffix from `s` that needs to be prepended is from this length to the end\n    suffix = s[longest_palindromic_prefix_length:]\n    \n    # Construct and return the shortest palindrome\n    return suffix[::-1] + s\n\n# Example usage\ns1 = \"aacecaaa\"\nprint(shortestPalindrome(s1))  # Output: \"aaacecaaa\"\n\ns2 = \"abcd\"\nprint(shortestPalindrome(s2))  # Output: \"dcbabcd\"\n```\n\nThis implementation efficiently computes the shortest palindrome by making use of the KMP algorithm for an O(n) time complexity solution, where n is the length of the string `s`.",
        "response_B": "Let me help you solve this problem step by step.\n\nThe key idea is to find the longest palindrome substring starting from the beginning of the string. Then, we only need to add the remaining characters in reverse order at the beginning.\n\nHere's a solution using the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef shortestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    # Create a new string temp = s + '#' + reverse(s)\n    # '#' is used as a delimiter to avoid false matches\n    temp = s + '#' + s[::-1]\n    \n    # Build the KMP failure table\n    n = len(temp)\n    failure = [0] * n\n    i = 1\n    j = 0\n    \n    while i < n:\n        if temp[i] == temp[j]:\n            failure[i] = j + 1\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n        elif j > 0:\n            j = failure[j-1]\n        else:\n            failure[i] = 0\n            i += 1\n    \n    # The last value in the failure table indicates the length of\n    # the longest palindrome substring from the start\n    longest_palindrome_length = failure[-1]\n    \n    # Add the remaining characters in reverse order\n    return s[longest_palindrome_length:][::-1] + s\n\n```\n\nLet's understand how this works:\n\n1. First, we handle the empty string case.\n\n2. We create a new string `temp` by concatenating:\n   - The original string `s`\n   - A delimiter '#'\n   - The reverse of string `s`\n\n3. We use the KMP algorithm to build the failure table. The last value in this table tells us the length of the longest palindrome substring starting from the beginning of the string.\n\n4. Finally, we take the remaining characters (after the longest palindrome), reverse them, and add them to the beginning of the original string.\n\nExample walkthrough:\n\nFor s = \"aacecaaa\":\n1. temp = \"aacecaaa#aaacecaa\"\n2. The failure table's last value tells us that \"aacecaa\" is the longest palindrome prefix\n3. We only need to add \"a\" at the beginning\n4. Result: \"aaacecaaa\"\n\nFor s = \"abcd\":\n1. temp = \"abcd#dcba\"\n2. The failure table's last value tells us that only \"a\" is a palindrome prefix\n3. We need to add \"dcb\" at the beginning\n4. Result: \"dcbabcd\"\n\nTime Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of string s\nSpace Complexity: O(n)\n\nThis solution is efficient because:\n1. It uses the KMP algorithm which has linear time complexity\n2. It avoids the need to check multiple possible palindromes\n3. It finds the longest palindrome prefix in a single pass\n\nThe solution handles all the constraints:\n- Works for empty strings\n- Works for strings up to 5 * 10^4 length\n- Works with lowercase English letters",

Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return _the **skyline** formed by these buildings collectively_.\n\nThe geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:\n\n*   `lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.\n*   `righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.\n*   `heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.\n\nYou may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.\n\nThe **skyline** should be represented as a list of \"key points \" **sorted by their x-coordinate** in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.\n\n**Note:** There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** buildings = \\[\\[2,9,10\\],\\[3,7,15\\],\\[5,12,12\\],\\[15,20,10\\],\\[19,24,8\\]\\]\n**Output:** \\[\\[2,10\\],\\[3,15\\],\\[7,12\\],\\[12,0\\],\\[15,10\\],\\[20,8\\],\\[24,0\\]\\]\n**Explanation:**\nFigure A shows the buildings of the input.\nFigure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings.

First, we convert building information into events:\n   - For each building, we create two events:\n     * Start event: (left_x, -height, right_x)\n     * End event: (right_x, 0, 0)\n   - We use negative height for start events to differentiate them from end events\n\n2. We sort all events by x-coordinate\n\n3. We process events in order, maintaining a max heap of active buildings:\n   - The heap contains tuples of (negative height, ending x-coordinate)\n   - For each event:\n     * Remove any buildings that have ended\n     * If it's a start event, add the building to the heap\n     * Get the maximum height from the heap\n     * If the height changes, add a new point to the skyline\n\n4. Return the resulting skyline\n\nTime Complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of buildings\n- Sorting events takes O(n log n)\n- Each building causes two heap operations, each taking O(log n)\n\nSpace Complexity: O(n) for storing events and heap\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nbuildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]\nresult = getSkyline(buildings)\nprint(result)  # [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]\n```\n\nThe solution handles all edge cases:\n- Overlapping buildings\n- Buildings of same height\n- Gaps between buildings\n- Single buildings\n- Multiple buildings ending at same point\n- Multiple buildings starting at same point\n\nThe output follows the required format:\n- Points are sorted by x-coordinate\n- No consecutive horizontal lines of equal height\n- Includes ground level (height 0) when needed\n- Properly marks the termination of skyline",
        "response_B": "To solve the problem of generating the skyline formed by the given buildings, we'll employ a sweep line algorithm with a priority queue (often implemented using a max heap) to keep track of the active building heights as we process through each x-coordinate. Here's the step-by-step outline of the approach:\n\n1. **Event Generation**:\n   - For each building described by `[lefti, righti, heighti]`, create two events: a start event at `lefti` with a height `heighti`, and an end event at `righti` with a height `-heighti`. The negative height for end events helps distinguish them from start events and allows them to be handled differently.\n   - Compile all events and sort them primarily by x-coordinate. In case of ties (same x-coordinate), prioritize starting events before ending events, and for starts by descending height and for ends by ascending height. This sorting ensures that the tallest building starts overriding any lower buildings at the same point, and that ending events don't prematurely drop the height while a taller building persist at the same point.\n\n2. **Sweep Line Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize a max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of active building heights. Also keep a variable `prev_max_height` to track the last contributing height to the skyline.\n   - Iterate through each event:\n     - If it's a start event (`height > 0`), add the building height to the heap.\n     - If it's an end event (`height < 0`), remove the corresponding building height from the heap.\n     - Determine the current max height from the heap (zero if the heap is empty).\n     - Compare the current max height with `prev_max_height`. If they differ, it indicates a change in the skyline, so you add the current x-coordinate and new height to the result and update `prev_max_height`.\n\n3. **Output Format**:\n   - Maintain the list of key points as described in the problem statement, ensuring that changes in height are only recorded, and consecutive key points with the same height are not duplicated.\n   - At the end of the processing, the last significant key point with y-coordinate `0` wraps up the skyline.\n\nHere is how you can implement the above outline in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom heapq import heappush, heappop\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef getSkyline(buildings):\n    # Generate the events\n    events = []\n    for left, right, height in buildings:\n        events.append((left, -height))  # start of a building\n        events.append((right, height))  # end of a building\n    \n    # Sort events, prioritizing:\n    # 1. x-coordinate, ascending\n    # 2.

This is because we need to efficiently find if there's an element within a specific range in a subarray defined by `indexDiff`, and a `SortedList` can help us maintain order and perform binary searches.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to the solution:\n\n1. **Initialize a `SortedList`:** This will help track the elements in the current window of indices and maintain their order. The `SortedList` allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and binary searching.\n\n2. **Iterate through `nums`:** For each element `nums[i]`, perform the following:\n   - Determine the current window that includes indices from `i - indexDiff` to `i - 1`.\n   - If `i` exceeds `indexDiff`, remove `nums[i - indexDiff - 1]` from the `SortedList` since it is no longer in the window.\n   - Use the `bisect_left` method to find the position where the current element could be potentially inserted such that all elements remain sorted.\n   - Check if there exists an element within the range `[nums[i] - valueDiff, nums[i] + valueDiff]` using binary search on the `SortedList`.\n   - If an element is found within the range, return `True` as there exists a valid pair `(j, i)` with `j < i`.\n   - Add `nums[i]` to the `SortedList` to include it in the current window.\n\n3. **Return `False`:** If no valid pair is found after checking all elements in `nums`, return `False`.\n\nThis approach leverages efficient ordered operations provided by `SortedList` to keep track of possible candidates for `j` during each iteration efficiently, ensuring the time complexity remains manageable.\n\nHere is the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\n\ndef containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(nums, indexDiff, valueDiff):\n    if indexDiff <= 0 or valueDiff < 0:\n        return False\n    \n    window = SortedList()\n    \n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        # Maintain the window of size indexDiff\n        if i > indexDiff:\n            window.remove(nums[i - indexDiff - 1])\n\n        # Find the position where nums[i] - valueDiff would fit\n        pos = window.bisect_left(nums[i] - valueDiff)\n        \n        # Check if there's a value within the range [nums[i] - valueDiff, nums[i] + valueDiff]\n        if pos < len(window) and abs(window[pos] - nums[i]) <= valueDiff:\n            return True\n        \n        # Add the current number to the window\n        window.add(nums[i])\n    \n    return False\n\n# Example usage:\nnums1 = [1, 2, 3, 1]\nindexDiff1 = 3\nvalueDiff1 = 0\nprint(containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(nums1, indexDiff1, valueDiff1))  # Output: True\n\nnums2 = [1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9]\nindexDiff2 = 2\nvalueDiff2 = 3\nprint(containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(nums2, indexDiff2, valueDiff2))  # Output: False\n```\n\nThis code efficiently handles the constraints provided by the problem statement, ensuring optimal performance across the input size limitations.",

        "response_A": "To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach to handle the nested expressions within parentheses.

Here's a clear and efficient approach using mathematical analysis to avoid directly traversing each number:\n\n### Approach\n\nThe key observation is to consider the contribution of '1' in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds, etc.).\n\nFor a given number `n`, let's analyze how many times the digit '1' appears in each position.\n\n1. **Position-based contribution**: \n    - Consider each digit position. For instance, if we're looking at 1352 and focusing on the hundreds position:\n    - Split the number around the target position. For index `i` (0-based from the right), split the number into three parts: the digits to the left of `i`, the digit at `i`, and the digits to the right of `i`.\n    - Use these parts to count occurrences of digit '1' at each position across all numbers from 0 to `n`.\n\n2. **General formula for position i (0 based from right)**:\n    - Let `left = n // (10^(i+1))`, `right = n % (10^i)`, and `digit = (n // 10^i) % 10`.\n    - `left_part` is the prefix numbers when '1' is fixed at position `i`, and `right_part` is the postfix numbers that follow.\n    - Count contribution of '1' for this position as:\n        - If `digit > 1`: Count is `(left + 1) * 10^i`.\n        - If `digit == 1`: Count is `left * 10^i + (right + 1)`.\n        - If `digit == 0`: Count is `left * 10^i`.\n        \n3. **Iterate through all positions** in the number and accumulate the count.\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere is the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef countDigitOne(n: int) -> int:\n    count = 0\n    i = 0\n    \n    while 10**i <= n:\n        divider = 10**i\n        left = n // (10 * divider)\n        right = n % divider\n        digit = (n // divider) % 10\n        \n        # If digit is 0, 1 is contributed by `left * 10^i`\n        # If digit is 1, 1 is contributed by `left * 10^i + (right + 1)`\n        # If digit > 1, 1 is contributed by `(left + 1) * 10^i`\n        if digit == 0:\n            count += left * divider\n        elif digit == 1:\n            count += left * divider + (right + 1)\n        else:\n            count += (left + 1) * divider\n        \n        i += 1\n    \n    return count\n\n# Example usage\nprint(countDigitOne(13))  # Output: 6\nprint(countDigitOne(0))   # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We loop over each digit position until `10^i` surpasses `n`.\n- We compute the left side of the current position digit, right side, and the digit itself.\n- Based on if the digit is 0, 1, or greater, we compute how many times '1' could appear in that particular position for numbers up to `n`.\n  \nThis approach efficiently counts the digit '1' without processing each number individually, resulting in a time complexity of O(log n), which is quite fast even for the upper constraint `n = 10^9`.",

Here’s the step-by-step solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef alienOrder(words):\n    # Step 1: Create a graph\n    graph = defaultdict(set)\n    in_degree = {char: 0 for word in words for char in word}\n    \n    # Step 2: Build the graph\n    for i in range(len(words) - 1):\n        first, second = words[i], words[i + 1]\n        min_length = min(len(first), len(second))\n        \n        # Check if second is a prefix of first - invalid case\n        if len(first) > len(second) and first[:min_length] == second[:min_length]:\n            return \" \"\n        \n        for j in range(min_length):\n            if first[j] != second[j]:\n                # Add a directed edge from first[j] -> second[j], indicating precedence\n                if second[j] not in graph[first[j]]:\n                    graph[first[j]].add(second[j])\n                    in_degree[second[j]] += 1\n                break\n    \n    # Step 3: Topological sort (Kahn's Algorithm)\n    # Start with nodes that have no incoming edges\n    queue = deque([char for char in in_degree if in_degree[char] == 0])\n    order = []\n    \n    while queue:\n        char = queue.popleft()\n        order.append(char)\n        \n        for neighbor in graph[char]:\n            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1\n            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n    \n    # If not all letters are used, it means there was a cycle, hence no valid ordering\n    if len(order) < len(in_degree):\n        return \" \"\n    \n    # Return the characters sorted by the alien language order\n    return \"\".join(order)\n\n# Example usage:\nwords1 = [\"wrt\", \"wrf\", \"er\", \"ett\", \"rftt\"]\nprint(alienOrder(words1))  # Output: \"wertf\"\n\nwords2 = [\"z\", \"x\"]\nprint(alienOrder(words2))  # Output: \"zx\"\n\nwords3 = [\"z\", \"x\", \"z\"]\nprint(alienOrder(words3))  # Output: \" \"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Graph Construction**: Build a graph where edges (`first[j]` to `second[j]`) represent lexicographical precedence (i.e., `first[j]` comes before `second[j]`).\n\n2. **Cycle Detection**: Use topological sorting to detect cycles. If we cannot add all nodes to the sorted list, there is a cycle in the graph (indicating that no valid order exists), thus return `\" \"`.\n\n3. **Processing**: Implement Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting. This uses a queue to process nodes with zero incoming edges, which are safe candidates for the next character in order.\n\nThis solution ensures any valid topological sorting will be a correct ordering of the alien language characters if one exists.",
        "response_B": "This problem can be solved using a graph-based approach, specifically using topological sorting. Here's a solution in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef alienOrder(words):\n    # Create adjacency list\n    adj = defaultdict(set)\n    # Create in-degree counter for each character\n    in_degree = {}\n    \n    # Initialize in_degree for all characters in words\n    for word in words:\n        for char in word:\n            in_degree[char] = 0\n    \n    # Build graph\n    for i in range(len(words) - 1):\n        word1 = words[i]\n        word2 = words[i + 1]\n        # Check if word2 is prefix of word1\n        if len(word1) > len(word2) and word1[:len(word2)] == word2:\n            return \"\"\n        \n        # Compare characters\n        for j in range(min(len(word1), len(word2))):\n            if word1[j] != word2[j]:\n                if word2[j] not in adj[word1[j]]:\n                    adj[word1[j]].add(word2[j])\n                    in_degree[word2[j]] += 1\n                break\n    \n    # Topological sort using BFS\n    queue = deque([c for c in in_degree if in_degree[c] == 0])\n    result = []\n    \n    while queue:\n        char = queue.popleft()\n        result.append(char)\n        \n        for next_char in adj[char]:\n            in_degree[next_char] -= 1\n            if in_degree[next_char] == 0:\n                queue.append(next_char)\n    \n    # Check if we have a valid ordering\n    if len(result) != len(in_degree):\n        return \"\"\n        \n    return \"\".join(result)\n```\n\nLet's go through how this solution works:\n\n1. We first create an adjacency list to represent the graph and an in-degree counter for each character.\n\n2. We initialize the in-degree counter for all characters that appear in the words.\n\n3. We build the graph by comparing adjacent words:\n   - For each pair of adjacent words, we find the first different character\n   - This different character pair represents an edge in our graph\n   - We add this edge to our adjacency list and increment the in-degree of the destination character\n\n4. We perform topological sort using BFS:\n   - Start with characters that have in-degree of 0\n   - For each character processed, decrease the in-degree of its adjacent characters\n   - Add characters to the queue when their in-degree becomes 0\n\n5. Finally, we check if we have a valid ordering by comparing the length of our result with the number of unique characters.\n\nFor the example inputs:\n\n```python\n# Example 1\nprint(alienOrder([\"wrt\", \"wrf\", \"er\", \"ett\", \"rftt\"]))  # \"wertf\"\n\n# Example 2\nprint(alienOrder([\"z\", \"x\"]))  # \"zx\"\n\n# Example 3\nprint(alienOrder([\"z\", \"x\", \"z\"]))  # \"\"\n```\n\nTime Complexity: O(C), where C is the total length of all characters in all words.\nSpace Complexity: O(1) since we only have lowercase English letters (maximum 26 characters).\n\nThe solution handles all the edge cases:\n- If there's a cycle in the graph (invalid ordering)\n- If a longer word appears before its prefix\n- If there are multiple valid orderings (returns any valid one)\n- If there's no valid ordering (returns empty string)",

Second solution (for balanced BST): O(k log n) where k is the number of closest values we need to find and n is the number of nodes\n\nSpace Complexity:\n1. First solution: O(k) for storing the result\n2. Second solution: O(log n) for the stacks (in a balanced BST)\n\nThe second solution is more efficient when the BST is balanced and k is significantly smaller than n, as it doesn't need to traverse the entire tree. It maintains two stacks:\n1. Predecessors stack: contains nodes with values smaller than target\n2. Successors stack: contains nodes with values larger than target\n\nIt then compares values from both stacks to find the k closest values to the target. This approach is similar to having two iterators, one going forward and one going backward, and choosing the closer value at each step.",
        "response_B": "To solve this problem efficiently, particularly if the BST is balanced, we can use a combination of two techniques: an inorder traversal to gather sorted node values and a min-heap (priority queue) to maintain the k closest values. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Inorder Traversal**: Perform an inorder traversal of the BST to extract the node values in sorted order. This step ensures that all the node values are processed in increasing order because of the properties of a BST.\n\n2. **Min-Heap for k Closest Values**: Utilize a min-heap to store pairs of (absolute difference from target, node value). The heap will be used to easily retrieve the k closest values.\n\n3. **Populate the Min-Heap**: As we traverse the tree:\n   - Calculate the absolute difference between the current node value and the target.\n   - Add the pair (difference, node value) to the min-heap.\n   - If the size of the heap exceeds k, remove the element with the largest difference (furthest from target), which is effectively maintaining the k closest values.\n\n4. **Extract Results**: Extract the k values from the heap. Since you only store k elements at any time, this operation is efficient.\n\nHere's how the implementation looks in Python:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef closestKValues(root, target, k):\n    # Step 1: Perform an inorder traversal and use a min-heap to find k closest values\n    min_heap = []\n\n    def inorder(node):\n        if not node:\n            return\n        # Traverse the left subtree\n        inorder(node.left)\n        # Process the current node\n        diff = abs(node.val - target)\n        # Use negative diff because heapq is a min-heap, and we need a max-heap\n        # to remove the element furthest from the target when size exceeds k\n        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (-diff, node.val))\n        if len(min_heap) > k:\n            heapq.heappop(min_heap)\n        # Traverse the right subtree\n        inorder(node.right)\n\n    # Perform the inorder traversal starting from the root\n    inorder(root)\n\n    # Step 2: Extract the values from the heap\n    return [val for _, val in min_heap]\n\n# Example usage\n# Construct the BST from the example\nroot = TreeNode(4)\nroot.left = TreeNode(2)\nroot.right = TreeNode(5)\nroot.left.left = TreeNode(1)\nroot.left.right = TreeNode(3)\n\n# Call the function with example inputs\nresult = closestKValues(root, 3.714286, 2)\nprint(result)  # Output: [4, 3]\n```\n\n**Complexity**:\n- **Time Complexity**: Though the inorder traversal itself is O(n), maintaining the size of the heap capped at k ensures that most operations related to heap (inserts and removals) remain O(log k). Thus, in a balanced BST, this solution is efficient in practice.\n- **Space Complexity**: The space used is primarily the heap space, which is O(k) in this specific case.\n\n**Follow-up Consideration**: If the BST is balanced and we needed to ensure better-than-O(n) efficiency, consider using a binary search approach directly on the tree for comparison and selection instead of traversing all nodes.",

Handle special cases for numbers like zero separately.\n\nHere's a Python function implementing these principles:\n\n```python\ndef numberToWords(num):\n    if num == 0:\n        return \"Zero\"\n    \n    below_20 = [\n        \"\", \"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\", \"Four\", \"Five\", \"Six\", \"Seven\", \"Eight\", \"Nine\",\n        \"Ten\", \"Eleven\", \"Twelve\", \"Thirteen\", \"Fourteen\", \"Fifteen\", \"Sixteen\",\n        \"Seventeen\", \"Eighteen\", \"Nineteen\"\n    ]\n    \n    tens = [\n        \"\", \"\", \"Twenty\", \"Thirty\", \"Forty\", \"Fifty\", \"Sixty\", \"Seventy\", \"Eighty\", \"Ninety\"\n    ]\n    \n    thousands = [\"\", \"Thousand\", \"Million\", \"Billion\"]\n    \n    def helper(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return \"\"\n        elif n < 20:\n            return below_20[n] + \" \"\n        elif n < 100:\n            return tens[n // 10] + \" \" + helper(n % 10)\n        else:\n            return below_20[n // 100] + \" Hundred \" + helper(n % 100)\n    \n    res = \"\"\n    for i, thousand in enumerate(thousands):\n        if num % 1000 != 0:\n            res = helper(num % 1000) + thousand + \" \" + res\n        num //= 1000\n    \n    return res.strip()\n\n# Testing the function with examples\nprint(numberToWords(123))      # Output: \"One Hundred Twenty Three\"\nprint(numberToWords(12345))    # Output: \"Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five\"\nprint(numberToWords(1234567))  # Output: \"One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **below_20**: Handles numbers from 0 to 19 directly since they have unique representations in English.\n- **tens**: Handles the tens multiples (20, 30, ..., 90) as these have distinct names.\n- **thousands**: Used to manage larger scales (thousands, millions, billions).\n- **helper function**: Converts numbers below 1000 to words. It separates out the hundreds, then deals with tens and units recursively.\n- The main logic processes the number in chunks of thousands, appending appropriate scale names from the `thousands` list.\n\nThis approach efficiently uses base ten properties alongside string concatenation to build the English word representation of the number.",

        "response_A": "To solve the problem of inserting binary operators '+', '-', and '*' between the digits of the string `num` to achieve a given `target` value, we can use a recursive backtracking approach. This method involves exploring all possible ways to create valid expressions by placing operators between the digits and evaluating these expressions to check if they equal the target.\n\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Recursive Exploration**: \n   - We will define a recursive helper function that takes current index (`pos`) in `num`, the current evaluated value (`curVal`) of the expression so far, the previously evaluated term (`prevTerm`) which is needed for proper multiplication handling, and the current expression (`expression` being built).\n   - The base case of recursion is when we have reached the end of the string (`pos == len(num)`). At this point, if the `curVal` equals the `target`, we add the current expression to the result list.\n\n2. **Iterate and Split Numbers**:\n   - At any position, we consider all possible splits of the string. For each potential new number (created by substrings), we check for leading zeros and skip those cases to ensure operands have no leading zeros.\n   - Convert the substring into an integer and try adding each of the operators (+, -, *) before the new substring.\n\n3. **Operator Handling**:\n   - For the '+' operator: Add the current number to the `curVal` and make it the `prevTerm`.\n   - For the '-' operator: Subtract the current number from the `curVal` and use its negative as the `prevTerm`.\n   - For the '*' operator: Here, we need to handle precedence correctly. We adjust the `curVal` by removing the effect of the `prevTerm` and then adding the product of `prevTerm` and the new number. This handles the multiplication precedence over addition and subtraction correctly.\n\n4. **Expression Building**:\n   - Keep building the `expression` string recursively by appending operators and new numbers.\n   - Start with the first number as the initial `curVal` and `prevTerm` since there's no operator before the first number.\n\n5. **Result Collection**:\n   - Collect all expressions that evaluate to the target and return them at the end.\n\nHere's the Python implementation of the described approach:\n\n```python\ndef addOperators(num, target):\n    def backtrack(pos, curVal, prevTerm, expression):\n        if pos == len(num):\n            if curVal == target:\n                results.append(\"\".join(expression))\n            return\n        \n        for i in range(pos, len(num)):\n            # Avoid numbers with leading zeros\n            if i != pos and num[pos] == '0':\n                break\n            # Slice the string to get current number\n            current_str = num[pos:i + 1]\n            current_num = int(current_str)\n            \n            if pos == 0:\n                # First number, we start the expression\n                backtrack(i + 1, current_num, current_num, [current_str])\n            else:\n                # Add, subtract, multiply\n                # Adding '+'\n                backtrack(i + 1, curVal + current_num, current_num,\n                          expression + ['+', current_str])\n                # Adding '-'\n                backtrack(i + 1, curVal - current_num, -current_num,\n                          expression + ['-', current_str])\n                # Adding '*'\n                backtrack(i + 1, curVal - prevTerm + prevTerm * current_num,\n                          prevTerm * current_num,\n                          expression + ['*', current_str])\n\n    results = []\n    if num:\n        backtrack(0, 0, 0, [])\n    \n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(addOperators(\"123\", 6))  # Output: [\"1*2*3\", \"1+2+3\"]\nprint(addOperators(\"232\", 8))  # Output: [\"2*3+2\", \"2+3*2\"]\nprint(addOperators(\"3456237490\", 9191))  # Output: []\n```\n\nThis recursive backtracking solution thoroughly explores all possibilities efficiently given the problem constraints and generates the desired expressions that evaluate to the target.",
        "response_B": "Here's a solution to the problem using backtracking:\n\n```python\ndef addOperators(num: str, target: int) -> list[str]:\n    result = []\n    \n    def backtrack(index: int, prev_operand: int, curr_operand: int, value: int, expression: list):\n        # Base case: if we've processed all digits\n        if index == len(num):\n            # If current value equals target and no operand is left\n            if value == target and curr_operand == 0:\n                result.append(''.join(expression[1:]))  # Remove first '+' from expression\n            return\n\n        # Current operand can be a multi-digit number\n        curr_operand = curr_operand * 10 + int(num[index])\n        str_operand = str(curr_operand)\n        \n        # If current operand is 0, we can't add more digits to it\n        if curr_operand > 0:\n            # Continue building current operand by recursing without adding any operator\n            backtrack(index + 1, prev_operand, curr_operand, value, expression)\n        \n        # If this is the first digit, we don't need operators\n        if not expression:\n            backtrack(index + 1, curr_operand, 0, curr_operand, expression + [str_operand])\n            return\n            \n        # Try addition\n        backtrack(index + 1, curr_operand, 0, value + curr_operand, \n                 expression + ['+', str_operand])\n        \n        # Try subtraction\n        backtrack(index + 1, -curr_operand, 0, value - curr_operand, \n                 expression + ['-', str_operand])\n        \n        # Try multiplication\n        # Need to subtract previous operand and add the multiplication result\n        backtrack(index + 1, curr_operand * prev_operand, 0, \n                 value - prev_operand + (curr_operand * prev_operand), \n                 expression + ['*', str_operand])\n        \n    backtrack(0, 0, 0, 0, [])\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution uses backtracking to try all possible combinations of operators between digits. Here's how it works:\n\n1. The `backtrack` function takes five parameters:\n   - `index`: current position in the input string\n   - `prev_operand`: previous operand (needed for multiplication)\n   - `curr_operand`: current operand being built\n   - `value`: current value of the expression\n   - `expression`: list storing the current expression\n\n2. Key aspects of the solution:\n   - Handles multi-digit numbers\n   - Prevents leading zeros by skipping further digit addition if current operand is 0\n   - Handles multiplication precedence by keeping track of the previous operand\n\n3. For each digit, we have these choices:\n   - Continue building current number (if it's not starting with 0)\n   - Add '+' operator\n   - Add '-' operator\n   - Add '*' operator\n\n4. For multiplication, we need to:\n   - Subtract the previous operand from the current value\n   - Multiply the current operand with previous operand\n   - Add the result back to the value\n\nTime Complexity: O(4^n), where n is the length of the input string. At each position, we have 4 choices (3 operators + combining with next digit).\nSpace Complexity: O(n) for the recursion stack.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nprint(addOperators(\"123\", 6))  # [\"1*2*3\", \"1+2+3\"]\nprint(addOperators(\"232\", 8))  # [\"2*3+2\", \"2+3*2\"]\nprint(addOperators(\"3456237490\", 9191))  # []\n```\n\nThe solution handles all the given test cases and constraints:\n- Works with strings of length 1 to 10\n- Handles only digit input\n- Supports target values in the given range\n- Prevents leading zeros in operands\n- Returns all possible valid expressions that evaluate to the target",

In `findMedian`:\n   - If lower has more elements, the median is the top of lower heap\n   - If they have equal size, the median is the average of both tops\n\nTime Complexity:\n- `addNum`: O(log n)\n- `findMedian`: O(1)\n\nSpace Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of numbers added\n\nFor the follow-up questions:\n\n1.

        "response_A": "Here's a solution to find the minimal total travel distance for friends meeting at a point:\n\n```python\ndef minTotalDistance(grid):\n    if not grid or not grid[0]:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Get all coordinates of friends\n    rows = []\n    cols = []\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                rows.append(i)\n                cols.append(j)\n    \n    # Sort coordinates\n    rows.sort()\n    cols.sort()\n    \n    # Find median point\n    median_row = rows[len(rows) // 2]\n    median_col = cols[len(cols) // 2]\n    \n    # Calculate total distance\n    total_distance = 0\n    for row in rows:\n        total_distance += abs(row - median_row)\n    for col in cols:\n        total_distance += abs(col - median_col)\n    \n    return total_distance\n```\n\nThis solution works by following these steps:\n\n1. First, we collect all coordinates (rows and columns) where friends are located (grid[i][j] == 1).\n\n2. We sort both row and column coordinates separately.\n\n3. We find the median points for both rows and columns. The median point will minimize the sum of absolute differences to all other points.\n\n4. We calculate the total Manhattan distance by summing up:\n   - The absolute differences between each friend's row coordinate and the median row\n   - The absolute differences between each friend's column coordinate and the median column\n\nWhy this works:\n- The Manhattan distance can be split into horizontal and vertical components\n- For 1D case, the point that minimizes the sum of absolute differences to other points is the median\n- This property holds true for Manhattan distance in 2D as we can treat x and y coordinates independently\n\nTime Complexity: O(mn log(mn)) where m and n are the dimensions of the grid. The sorting step dominates the time complexity.\nSpace Complexity: O(mn) to store the coordinates of all friends.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\n# Example 1\ngrid1 = [[1,0,0,0,1],\n         [0,0,0,0,0],\n         [0,0,1,0,0]]\nprint(minTotalDistance(grid1))  # Output: 6\n\n# Example 2\ngrid2 = [[1,1]]\nprint(minTotalDistance(grid2))  # Output: 1\n```\n\nNote that this solution is optimal because:\n1. The median minimizes the sum of absolute differences in 1D\n2. Manhattan distance can be decomposed into independent x and y components\n3. Therefore, the meeting point at (median_row, median_col) will give us the minimal total travel distance.",
        "response_B": "To solve the problem of finding the minimal total travel distance, we can leverage the properties of the Manhattan distance and the median of a set of points.\n\n### Key Insight:\nThe optimal meeting point that minimizes the sum of Manhattan distances in a line is always located at the median of the coordinates. This holds true separately for both the x-coordinates and y-coordinates. \n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Collect Coordinates**:\n   - Extract the rows (x-coordinates) and columns (y-coordinates) of all the homes (grid cells with `1`).\n\n2. **Sort and Find Median**:\n   - Sort the lists of x-coordinates and y-coordinates.\n   - The median of these sorted lists will provide the best meeting points for minimal travel distance.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Distance**:\n   - Calculate the total travel distance by summing up the Manhattan distances from each home to the median coordinate.\n\n### Implementation:\nHere's how you can implement the above strategy in Python:\n\n```python\ndef minTotalDistance(grid):\n    if not grid or not grid[0]:\n        return 0\n    \n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    x_coords = []\n    y_coords = []\n\n    # Collect x coordinates (rows)\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 1:\n                x_coords.append(r)\n\n    # Collect y coordinates (columns)\n    for c in range(cols):\n        for r in range(rows):\n            if grid[r][c] == 1:\n                y_coords.append(c)\n\n    # Find the median in the sorted list\n    def find_median(coords):\n        coords.sort()\n        length = len(coords)\n        return coords[length // 2]  # Median\n\n    # Median x and y\n    median_x = find_median(x_coords)\n    median_y = find_median(y_coords)\n\n    # Calculate the total distance to the median point\n    total_distance = 0\n    for x in x_coords:\n        total_distance += abs(x - median_x)\n    for y in y_coords:\n        total_distance += abs(y - median_y)\n\n    return total_distance\n\n# Example Usage\ngrid1 = [[1,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]\ngrid2 = [[1,1]]\n\nprint(minTotalDistance(grid1))  # Output: 6\nprint(minTotalDistance(grid2))  # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Collecting Coordinates**: By iterating through the grid, we generate two lists: `x_coords` for row indices of `1s` and `y_coords` for column indices.\n- **Finding Medians**: We sort the coordinate lists and find their respective medians. This is efficient due to the sorting step, which is typically \\(O(n \\log n)\\).\n- **Distance Calculation**: We compute the Manhattan distances from each point to the medians, which ensures we get the minimum total distance.\n\nThis method ensures an efficient computation with a time complexity largely determined by the sorting step, making it suitable for the grid sizes specified in the problem constraints.",

        "response_A": "To implement a serialization and deserialization mechanism for a binary tree, we can represent the tree using a pre-order traversal approach. We'll use a special marker (e.g., 'N') for null nodes to distinguish between actual values and placeholders for absent children.\n\nHere’s a step-by-step explanation and pseudocode for both serializing and deserializing a binary tree:\n\n### Serialization\n\n1. **Traverse the Tree:** Perform a pre-order traversal of the tree (visit the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree).\n2. **Handle Nulls:** Use a special character (e.g., 'N') to represent null (non-existent) nodes.\n3. **Store Values:** Gather all node values and markers into a single string, separating values and markers with commas.\n\n**Pseudocode for Serialize:**\n```plaintext\nserialize(node):\n    if node is None:\n        return \"N\"\n    left_serialized = serialize(node.left)\n    right_serialized = serialize(node.right)\n    return str(node.val) + \",\" + left_serialized + \",\" + right_serialized\n```\n\n### Deserialization\n\n1. **Split Values:** Split the serialized string by commas to retrieve each node value or marker.\n2. **Reconstruct Tree:** Using the sequence of values, reconstruct the tree by creating nodes for values and skipping creation for markers.\n3. **Recursive Reconstruction:** Depend on recursive calls corresponding to pre-order traversal order to ensure the correct tree structure is reconstructed.\n\n**Pseudocode for Deserialize:**\n```plaintext\ndeserialize(data):\n    values = data.split(',')\n    index = 0\n\n    def helper():\n        nonlocal index\n        if values[index] == 'N':\n            index += 1\n            return None\n        node = TreeNode(int(values[index]))\n        index += 1\n        node.left = helper()\n        node.right = helper()\n        return node\n\n    return helper()\n```\n\n### Python Implementation\n\nHere’s a Python implementation of the above algorithm:\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\nclass Codec:\n    def serialize(self, root):\n        def serialize_helper(node):\n            if node is None:\n                return 'N,'\n            return str(node.val) + ',' + serialize_helper(node.left) + serialize_helper(node.right)\n        \n        return serialize_helper(root)\n        \n    def deserialize(self, data):\n        values = data.split(',')\n        index = 0\n        \n        def deserialize_helper():\n            nonlocal index\n            if values[index] == 'N':\n                index += 1\n                return None\n            \n            node = TreeNode(int(values[index]))\n            index += 1\n            node.left = deserialize_helper()\n            node.right = deserialize_helper()\n            return node\n        \n        return deserialize_helper()\n\n# Example Usage:\n# codec = Codec()\n# root = codec.deserialize(\"1,2,N,N,3,4,N,N,5,N,N,\")\n# serialized_data = codec.serialize(root)\n# print(serialized_data)  # Output: \"1,2,N,N,3,4,N,N,5,N,N,\"\n```\n\nThis algorithm efficiently serializes and deserializes a binary tree structure, ensuring the order and structure are preserved. The use of recursive pre-order traversal, along with the special character 'N' for null nodes, allows seamless encoding and decoding of the tree.",
        "response_B": "I'll provide a solution that uses preorder traversal for serialization and deserialization of the binary tree.

Regular binary trees with various structures\n2. Empty trees (returns \"null\")\n3. Trees with single nodes\n4. Trees with negative values\n5. Unbalanced trees\n\nThe solution is also efficient and maintains the exact structure of the original tree during serialization and deserialization.",
