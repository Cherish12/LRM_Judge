We aim to determine the sum of the elements of \\( A \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n\n1. **Interpret the Problem**:\n    - Bob lists all finite nonempty subsets \\( B \\) of positive integers where the maximum element of each \\( B \\) is an element of \\( A \\).\n    - Each subset \\( B \\) can be uniquely represented by choosing its maximum element from \\( A \\) and including any subset of integers that do not exceed this maximum element.\n\n2. **Analyze the Count of Sets**:\n    - Consider the number of subsets generated by each element \\( k \\) in \\( A \\).\n    \n    - For a specific \\( k \\) in \\( A \\):\n        - It acts as the maximum.\n        - We can include any subset (including empty) of \\(\\{1, 2, ..., k-1\\}\\).\n        - This gives \\( 2^{k-1} \\) possibilities (including the empty subset), but we have to exclude the empty set itself for nonempty sets.\n        \n    - Therefore, if \\( A = \\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\\} \\), then:\n        - Total number of sets \\( B \\) = \\( 2^{a_1-1} + 2^{a_2-1} + ... + 2^{a_n-1} \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Sum Required**:\n    - From the problem, we know the total number of sets \\( B \\) is 2024. Thus, solving:\n    \\[\n    2^{a_1-1} + 2^{a_2-1} + ... + 2^{a_n-1} = 2024\n    \\]\n\n    - We break this down using the properties of powers of 2.\n\n4. **Decompose 2024 into Powers of 2**:\n    - 2024 in binary: \\( 2024 \\div 2 \\) repeatedly yields 2 as:\n    \\[\n    2024 = 2^{10} - 2^3 - 2^2 + 2^3 = 11 + 10 + 1 - 2 = 11111100100_2,\n    \\]\n\n    Simplifying back gives:\n    \\[\n    2024 = 2^{10} + 2^3 + 2^2 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8 + 4\n    \\]\n\n    - The powers are:\n    \\[\n    2024 = 2^{10} + 2^{3} + 2^2 = 11\\;+\\;8\\;+\\;1 - 0 = 1249\n    .\n\n5. **Sum of Corresponding Elements in \\( A \\) from Equation**:\n    Each power corresponds to maximum elements of form \\( k \\).\n\n\\[\nSum\\ corresponding = 8 + 4 + 2 = 1010:\n  .\n\n\n Hence, the solver calculates \n\\sum of all elements  integer 131 \n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTherefore, the sum of elements in the set \\( A \\) that satisfies above properties and yields exactly 2024 finite sets as required:\n\n\\(\\boxed{011}\\):\n\n",
