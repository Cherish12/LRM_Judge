        "response_A": "To determine the largest impossible amount of money using coins valued at 6, 10, and 15, we need to employ the theory related to the Frobenius number when multiple coin values are considered.

Let's work backwards from the end to the beginning\n* We know there are 25 people heading to the third stop\n* Before this, at the second stop:\n   * 6 people got down\n   * 8 people got in\n   * So before the 8 got in, there were 25 - 8 = 17 people\n   * And before 6 got down, there were 17 + 6 = 23 people\n\n2. At the first stop:\n   * 4 people got in\n   * Half of the original people got down\n   * So 23 - 4 = 19 people were there before 4 got in\n   * If half got down, then the other half remained = 19 people\n\n3. Therefore:\n   * Let's say x people started at terminal\n   * After half got down, x/2 people remained\n   * So: x/2 = 19\n   * x = 38\n\nTherefore, 38 people got on the bus at the terminal.\n\nTo verify:\n* 38 people at start\n* At first stop: 19 (half of 38) + 4 = 23 people\n* At second stop: 23 - 6 + 8 = 25 people\n* This matches with the final number given\n\nThe answer is 38 people.",
