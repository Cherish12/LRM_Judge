It uses `std::string::find` to locate occurrences of the word in the line, and checks that the word is isolated (i.e., not a part of another word) by ensuring that characters before and after the match are not alphabetic.\n\n2. **Main Function**: \n   - Prompts the user to enter the filename and the target word.\n   - Attempts to open the file specified. If unsuccessful, it prints an error message and exits.\n   - Reads each line of the file, calling `countOccurrences` to count how many times the word appears isolated in each line.\n   - Accumulates the total occurrences and displays the result.\n\n### Points to Consider:\n- This program is case-sensitive. If you want case-insensitive counting, convert both the line and word to lowercase using `std::transform` with `std::tolower`.\n- The program checks words for isolation using standard character checks, considering a word isolated if it is not immediately preceded or followed by an alphabetical character.\n",

        "question": "Implement a regular expression in Python to validate an email address.",
        "response_A": "To validate an email address in Python using a regular expression, you can use the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions. Below is a simple implementation for email validation using a regular expression. This particular regex pattern will accommodate common email address formats, though keep in mind that email validation can be complex due to the vast range of allowed characters and formats according to the official specifications (RFC 5322).\n\nHere is a Python function that uses a regular expression to validate email addresses:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef is_valid_email(email):\n    # Regular expression pattern for validating an email\n    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$'\n    \n    # Using re.match to check if the email matches the pattern\n    return re.match(pattern, email) is not None\n\n# Examples of usage:\nprint(is_valid_email(\"example@example.com\"))  # Should return True\nprint(is_valid_email(\"user.name+tag+sorting@example.com\"))  # Should return True\nprint(is_valid_email(\"invalid-email@example\"))  # Should return False\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Regular Expression:\n\n- `^` asserts the start of the string.\n- `[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+` matches one or more of the following characters: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, underscores, dots, plus signs, and hyphens.\n- `@` is the literal symbol for the at sign.\n- `[a-zA-Z0-9-]+` matches one or more of the domain name characters: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens.\n- `\\.` escapes the dot, as the dot itself has a special meaning in regex (matching any character). This is used to separate the domain and the top-level domain.\n- `[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+` matches one or more top-level domain characters: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, dots, and hyphens.\n- `$` asserts the end of the string.\n\nThis regex provides a basic level of validation, checking the overall structure of the email address. It's a balance between complexity and typical use cases but doesn't cover all edge cases found in the full email specification.",

This is a simplified email validation regex. The full RFC 5322 standard for email addresses is much more complex.\n\n2. This regex validates the basic structure of an email address but doesn't verify:\n   - Whether the email actually exists\n   - Whether the domain has valid MX records\n   - Special cases like quoted strings in email addresses\n\n3. For production use, you might want to:\n   - Add more specific validation rules\n   - Use established email validation libraries\n   - Implement actual email verification through sending confirmation emails\n\n4. Common alternatives for production use include:\n   - Using the `email-validator` package\n   - Using Django's email validator\n   - Using WTForms email validator\n\nFor even more robust validation, you could use:\n\n```python\nfrom email_validator import validate_email, EmailNotValidError\n\ndef validate_email_address(email):\n    try:\n        # Validate and get normalized form of email\n        valid = validate_email(email)\n        return True\n    except EmailNotValidError as e:\n        print(str(e))\n        return False\n```\n\nThis provides more comprehensive validation but requires installing the `email-validator` package first:\n```bash\npip install email-validator\n```",

Space-Optimized Version (Only storing last two numbers):\n```python\ndef fibonacci_space_optimized(n):\n    # Handle base cases\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n        \n    # Initialize variables for previous two numbers\n    prev2 = 0  # (n-2)th number\n    prev1 = 1  # (n-1)th number\n    current = 0\n    \n    # Calculate Fibonacci number\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        current = prev1 + prev2\n        prev2 = prev1\n        prev1 = current\n    \n    return current\n\n# Test the function\ndef main():\n    n = int(input(\"Enter the value of n: \"))\n    result = fibonacci_space_optimized(n)\n    print(f\"The {n}th Fibonacci number is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nAll three approaches have their advantages:\n\n1. Bottom-Up (Tabulation):\n   - Iterative approach\n   - Uses O(n) space to store all Fibonacci numbers\n   - Good when you need to store all Fibonacci numbers up to n\n   - Time complexity: O(n)\n   - Space complexity: O(n)\n\n2.

For large numbers, you might want to use Python's built-in support for large integers or implement a modulo operation if you only need the result modulo some number.",
        "response_B": "Certainly! To find the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming, we can employ a bottom-up approach. This approach involves building up our solution using previously computed values, which are stored in a table (array) for efficiency. Below, you'll find a Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    # Ensure n is a non-negative integer\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input should be a non-negative integer\")\n    \n    # Base cases\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n\n    # Create an array to store Fibonacci numbers\n    fib = [0] * (n + 1)\n    fib[0] = 0\n    fib[1] = 1\n\n    # Build up the Fibonacci sequence\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]\n\n    # The nth Fibonacci number\n    return fib[n]\n\n# Example usage\nnth_fib_number = fibonacci(10)\nprint(f\"The 10th Fibonacci number is: {nth_fib_number}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: We begin by checking if `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is negative, the program raises an error.\n\n2. **Base Cases**: The Fibonacci sequence's base cases are defined. If `n` is 0, the Fibonacci number is 0. If `n` is 1, the Fibonacci number is 1.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: We initialize a list `fib` of zeros with a size of `n+1`, ensuring it holds Fibonacci numbers up to the nth position.\n\n4. **Building the Sequence**: Using a loop, we fill in the Fibonacci numbers from the 2nd to the nth. Each Fibonacci number is computed using the sum of its two preceding numbers, `fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]`.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: After constructing the array, the nth Fibonacci number is returned, which resides in `fib[n]`.\n\nThis implementation is efficient, having a time complexity of \\(O(n)\\) and a space complexity of \\(O(n)\\).",

This algorithm assumes that the input array is sorted in ascending order.\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform a binary search on a sorted array to find the target element.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    arr (list): A list of sorted elements.\n    target : The element to search for in the array.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The index of the target element in the array if found; otherwise, -1.\n    \"\"\"\n    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    \n    while left <= right:\n        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # Calculate mid index to prevent overflow\n        \n        # Check if the target is present at mid\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        \n        # If target is greater, ignore left half\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n            \n        # If target is smaller, ignore right half\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n            \n    # Target is not present in the array\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\ntarget_element = 7\n\nindex = binary_search(array, target_element)\nif index != -1:\n    print(f\"Element {target_element} found at index {index}.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Element {target_element} not found in the array.\")\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n1. **Initialization**: Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are inizialized at the start and end of the array, respectively.\n2. **Repeated Division**: We calculate the middle index `mid` of the current search interval.\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - If the element at the `mid` index is the target, the search is complete, and the index is returned.\n   - If the element at `mid` is less than the target, it means the target must be in the right sub-array. Hence, we update `left` to `mid + 1`.\n   - If the element at `mid` is greater than the target, it must be in the left sub-array. We update `right` to `mid - 1`.\n4. **Conclusion**: The process repeats until `left` exceeds `right`, which indicates that the target is not present in the array, and `-1` is returned.",

Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nclass QueueUsingStacks:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.stack_in = []  # Stack for enqueue operations\n        self.stack_out = [] # Stack for dequeue operations\n\n    def enqueue(self, item):\n        # Simply push the item onto the input stack\n        self.stack_in.append(item)\n\n    def dequeue(self):\n        # If output stack is empty, move elements from input stack\n        if not self.stack_out:\n            while self.stack_in:\n                self.stack_out.append(self.stack_in.pop())\n        # If output stack is still empty, queue is empty\n        if not self.stack_out:\n            raise IndexError(\"dequeue from an empty queue\")\n        # Pop the element from the output stack\n        return self.stack_out.pop()\n\n    def peek(self):\n        # Check the front element without removing it\n        if not self.stack_out:\n            while self.stack_in:\n                self.stack_out.append(self.stack_in.pop())\n        if not self.stack_out:\n            raise IndexError(\"peek from an empty queue\")\n        return self.stack_out[-1]\n\n    def is_empty(self):\n        # Queue is empty if both stacks are empty\n        return not self.stack_in and not self.stack_out\n\n# Example usage\nqueue = QueueUsingStacks()\nqueue.enqueue(1)\nqueue.enqueue(2)\nqueue.enqueue(3)\nprint(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 1\nprint(queue.peek())     # Output: 2\nprint(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 2\nprint(queue.is_empty()) # Output: False\nprint(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 3\nprint(queue.is_empty()) # Output: True\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **enqueue(item):** This method simply pushes the new item onto `stack_in`. This operation is O(1).\n- **dequeue():** If `stack_out` is empty, all elements from `stack_in` are moved to `stack_out`, effectively reversing the order of elements. Then, the top item from `stack_out` is popped, which represents the front of the queue. This operation is amortized O(1) because each element is moved only once from `stack_in` to `stack_out`.\n- **peek():** Similar to `dequeue`, but returns the top element of `stack_out` without removing it.\n- **is_empty():** This simply checks whether both stacks are empty.\n\nThis implementation efficiently mimics a queue using two stacks, maintaining correct order for both enqueue and dequeue operations.",

This approach is sometimes called \"stack queue\" and demonstrates how we can achieve FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior using two LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) stacks.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nclass QueueUsingStacks:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Stack for enqueuing elements\n        self.stack1 = []\n        # Stack for dequeuing elements\n        self.stack2 = []\n    \n    def enqueue(self, item):\n        \"\"\"\n        Add an item to the back of the queue\n        Time Complexity: O(1)\n        \"\"\"\n        self.stack1.append(item)\n    \n    def dequeue(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Remove and return the item at the front of the queue\n        Time Complexity: Amortized O(1), Worst case O(n)\n        \"\"\"\n        # If both stacks are empty, queue is empty\n        if not self.stack1 and not self.stack2:\n            raise IndexError(\"Queue is empty\")\n            \n        # If stack2 is empty, transfer all elements from stack1\n        if not self.stack2:\n            while self.stack1:\n                self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop())\n                \n        # Return the top element from stack2\n        return self.stack2.pop()\n    \n    def peek(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Return the item at the front of the queue without removing it\n        Time Complexity: Amortized O(1), Worst case O(n)\n        \"\"\"\n        if not self.stack1 and not self.stack2:\n            raise IndexError(\"Queue is empty\")\n            \n        if not self.stack2:\n            while self.stack1:\n                self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop())\n                \n        return self.stack2[-1]\n    \n    def is_empty(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Check if the queue is empty\n        Time Complexity: O(1)\n        \"\"\"\n        return len(self.stack1) == 0 and len(self.stack2) == 0\n    \n    def size(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Return the number of items in the queue\n        Time Complexity: O(1)\n        \"\"\"\n        return len(self.stack1) + len(self.stack2)\n\n# Example usage:\ndef main():\n    queue = QueueUsingStacks()\n    \n    # Test enqueue\n    queue.enqueue(1)\n    queue.enqueue(2)\n    queue.enqueue(3)\n    print(\"Queue size after enqueuing 1, 2, 3:\", queue.size())  # Should print 3\n    \n    # Test dequeue\n    print(\"Dequeued item:\", queue.dequeue())  # Should print 1\n    print(\"Queue size after dequeue:\", queue.size())  # Should print 2\n    \n    # Test peek\n    print(\"Front item:\", queue.peek())  # Should print 2\n    \n    # Test is_empty\n    print(\"Is queue empty?\", queue.is_empty())  # Should print False\n    \n    # Dequeue remaining items\n    print(\"Dequeued item:\", queue.dequeue())  # Should print 2\n    print(\"Dequeued item:\", queue.dequeue())  # Should print 3\n    \n    print(\"Is queue empty?\", queue.is_empty())  # Should print True\n    \n    try:\n        queue.dequeue()  # Should raise an IndexError\n    except IndexError as e:\n        print(\"Error:\", str(e))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis implementation has the following features:\n\n1. Uses two stacks internally:\n   - `stack1`: Used for enqueuing elements\n   - `stack2`: Used for dequeuing elements\n\n2. Main operations:\n   - `enqueue`: Adds an item to the back of the queue (O(1))\n   - `dequeue`: Removes and returns the item from the front of the queue (Amortized O(1))\n   - `peek`: Returns the front item without removing it (Amortized O(1))\n   - `is_empty`: Checks if the queue is empty (O(1))\n   - `size`: Returns the number of items in the queue (O(1))\n\n3. Working principle:\n   - New elements are always pushed to `stack1`\n   - When dequeuing or peeking, if `stack2` is empty, all elements from `stack1` are transferred to `stack2`\n   - This transfer reverses the order of elements, effectively converting LIFO to FIFO\n\n4. Time complexity:\n   - Enqueue: O(1)\n   - Dequeue: Amortized O(1), Worst case O(n)\n   - Peek: Amortized O(1), Worst case O(n)\n   - Is_empty: O(1)\n   - Size: O(1)\n\nThe amortized time complexity for dequeue and peek operations is O(1) because the transfer of elements from stack1 to stack2 happens only when stack2 is empty, and each element is transferred at most once.\n\nWhen you run the main function, it will demonstrate all the operations and their results. The implementation handles edge cases like trying to dequeue from an empty queue by raising an IndexError.",

        "response_A": "Here's a program to find common elements in two arrays without using any extra data structures. I'll provide solutions using different approaches:\n\n1. Simple Two-Pointer Approach (for sorted arrays):\n```python\ndef findCommonElements(arr1, arr2):\n    # First sort both arrays\n    arr1.sort()\n    arr2.sort()\n    \n    i = 0  # pointer for arr1\n    j = 0  # pointer for arr2\n    \n    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):\n        if arr1[i] == arr2[j]:\n            print(arr1[i], end=\" \")\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n        elif arr1[i] < arr2[j]:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n\n# Test the function\narr1 = [4, 2, 7, 1, 5]\narr2 = [3, 5, 2, 8, 4]\nprint(\"Common elements:\", end=\" \")\nfindCommonElements(arr1, arr2)  # Output: 2 4 5\n```\n\n2. In-place Marking Approach (when elements are positive and within a range):\n```python\ndef findCommonElements(arr1, arr2):\n    # Mark elements in arr1\n    for i in range(len(arr1)):\n        if arr1[i] > 0:  # Only process positive numbers\n            for j in range(len(arr2)):\n                if arr1[i] == abs(arr2[j]):\n                    print(arr1[i], end=\" \")\n                    break\n\n# Test the function\narr1 = [4, 2, 7, 1, 5]\narr2 = [3, 5, 2, 8, 4]\nprint(\"Common elements:\", end=\" \")\nfindCommonElements(arr1, arr2)  # Output: 4 2 5\n```\n\n3. Using XOR approach (when arrays have only binary values):\n```python\ndef findCommonElements(arr1, arr2):\n    for i in range(len(arr1)):\n        for j in range(len(arr2)):\n            # Using XOR to check equality\n            if (arr1[i] ^ arr2[j]) == 0:\n                print(arr1[i], end=\" \")\n                break\n\n# Test the function\narr1 = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\narr2 = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nprint(\"Common elements:\", end=\" \")\nfindCommonElements(arr1, arr2)  # Output: 1 0 1\n```\n\n4. Using Division Method (when elements are positive and array modification is allowed):\n```python\ndef findCommonElements(arr1, arr2):\n    # Choose a number greater than all array elements\n    max_element = max(max(arr1), max(arr2))\n    divisor = max_element + 1\n    \n    # Mark elements by multiplying with divisor\n    for i in range(len(arr1)):\n        for j in range(len(arr2)):\n            if arr1[i] == arr2[j] and arr2[j] < divisor:\n                print(arr1[i], end=\" \")\n                arr2[j] *= divisor\n                break\n\n# Test the function\narr1 = [4, 2, 7, 1, 5]\narr2 = [3, 5, 2, 8, 4]\nprint(\"Common elements:\", end=\" \")\nfindCommonElements(arr1, arr2)  # Output: 4 2 5\n```\n\nEach approach has its own advantages and limitations:\n\n1. Two-Pointer Approach:\n- Requires sorting (O(n log n) time)\n- Best when arrays are already sorted\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n- Doesn't modify original arrays\n\n2. In-place Marking:\n- Works only with positive numbers\n- Time complexity: O(n²)\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n- May modify original arrays\n\n3. XOR Approach:\n- Works only with binary values\n- Time complexity: O(n²)\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n- Doesn't modify original arrays\n\n4. Division Method:\n- Works only with positive numbers\n- Time complexity: O(n²)\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n- Modifies original arrays\n\nChoose the appropriate method based on:\n- Whether array modification is allowed\n- Nature of elements (positive/negative/binary)\n- Whether arrays are sorted\n- Performance requirements\n- Space constraints\n\nThe Two-Pointer approach is generally the most efficient when sorting is allowed, while other methods might be more suitable for specific scenarios or constraints.",
        "response_B": "To find common elements in two arrays without using any extra data structures, we can use a brute force approach, comparing each element of the first array with each element of the second array. This method ensures that no additional data structures like sets or hash tables are used. Here is a simple Python program that demonstrates this approach:\n\n```python\ndef find_common_elements(arr1, arr2):\n    common_elements = []\n\n    for element1 in arr1:\n        for element2 in arr2:\n            if element1 == element2:\n                # Check if the element is already in the common_elements list\n                if element1 not in common_elements:\n                    common_elements.append(element1)\n\n    return common_elements\n\n# Example arrays\narray1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narray2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n# Find common elements without using extra data structures\ncommon = find_common_elements(array1, array2)\n\nprint(\"Common elements:\", common)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Loop Through First Array**: Iterate over each element in the first array.\n2. **Nested Loop for Second Array**: For each element in the first array, iterate over each element in the second array.\n3. **Compare Elements**: Check if the elements from the two arrays are equal.\n4. **Avoid Duplicates**: Before appending to the result list (`common_elements`), check if the element is already included to avoid duplicates.\n5. **Return Result**: Once all elements are checked, return the `common_elements` list.\n\n### Limitations:\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n and m are the sizes of the two arrays. This is due to the nested loop that performs a comparison for each pair of elements.\n- **Not Efficient for Large Arrays**: The performance can degrade significantly with large input sizes due to the brute force approach.\n\nThis method fulfills the requirement of not using any extra data structures beyond simple variables and lists that are necessary for storage of results.",
