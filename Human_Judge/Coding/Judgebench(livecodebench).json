The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) — the number of the test cases. This is followed by their description.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($0 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^5$) — the length of the string $s$ and the number of characters to be deleted.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output \"YES\" if it is possible to remove exactly $k$ characters from the string $s$ in such a way that the remaining characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (uppercase or lowercase).

        "response_A": "I'll help you solve this problem. Let's break it down and implement a solution.\n\nThe key insight is that for a valid original array:\n1. Each element in derived is created by XORing adjacent elements in original (with the last element wrapping around to the first)\n2. For a binary array, if we know one element, we can reconstruct the rest using the derived array\n3. The final check needs to verify if the reconstructed array actually produces the given derived array\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n```python:solution.py\ndef doesValidArrayExist(derived: List[int]) -> bool:\n    n = len(derived)\n    \n    # Special case for length 1\n    if n == 1:\n        return derived[0] == 0\n    \n    # Try with original[0] = 0\n    original = [0] * n\n    \n    # Reconstruct the array assuming original[0] = 0\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        # If derived[i] = original[i] ⊕ original[i+1]\n        # Then original[i+1] = derived[i] ⊕ original[i]\n        original[i + 1] = derived[i] ^ original[i]\n    \n    # Check if the array is valid by verifying the last XOR\n    # derived[n-1] should equal original[n-1] ⊕ original[0]\n    return derived[n-1] == (original[n-1] ^ original[0])\n```\n\nLet's go through how this solution works:\n\n1. For an array of length 1, it's only valid if derived[0] = 0 (since original[0] ⊕ original[0] must equal derived[0])\n\n2. For arrays of length > 1:\n   - We start by assuming original[0] = 0\n   - For each index i, we can determine original[i+1] using:\n     original[i+1] = derived[i] ⊕ original[i]\n   - After reconstructing the array, we verify if it's valid by checking the last condition:\n     derived[n-1] = original[n-1] ⊕ original[0]\n\n3. If the check passes, it means a valid original array exists. If it fails, we can prove no valid array exists.\n\nTime Complexity: O(n)\nSpace Complexity: O(n)\n\nNote: We only need to try original[0] = 0 because:\n- If a solution exists with original[0] = 1, flipping all bits in that solution would give us a valid solution with original[0] = 0\n- If no solution exists with original[0] = 0, no solution exists with original[0] = 1 either\n\nThe solution handles all the example cases:\n- For [1,1,0]: Returns true\n- For [1,1]: Returns true\n- For [1,0]: Returns false",

First, we concatenate the three numbers:\n   - n\n   - 2*n\n   - 3*n\n   We do this by converting them to strings and joining them together.\n\n2. We perform several checks:\n   - If the concatenated string's length isn't 9, it can't be fascinating\n   - If it contains '0', it can't be fascinating\n   - If there are any duplicate digits (checked using set length), it can't be fascinating\n   - If any digit from 1-9 is missing, it can't be fascinating\n\n3. If all checks pass, the number is fascinating\n\nExample usage:\n```python\n# Example 1\nprint(isFascinating(192))  # True\n# Because:\n# 192 concatenated with 384 (2*192) and 576 (3*192)\n# gives 192384576, which contains all digits 1-9 once\n\n# Example 2\nprint(isFascinating(100))  # False\n# Because:\n# 100 concatenated with 200 (2*100) and 300 (3*100)\n# gives 100200300, which contains zeros and missing digits\n```\n\nAlternative shorter solution:\n```python\ndef isFascinating(n: int) -> bool:\n    concatenated = str(n) + str(2*n) + str(3*n)\n    return sorted(concatenated) == ['1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9']\n```\n\nThis shorter version:\n1. Creates the concatenated string\n2. Sorts its digits\n3. Checks if it exactly matches the sequence '1' through '9'\n\nBoth solutions will work correctly for the given constraints (100 ≤ n ≤ 999). The first solution might be more readable and easier to understand, while the second one is more concise but might be slightly less intuitive.",

We use memoization to cache results we've already computed to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n4. The function returns -1 if it's impossible to reach 0, otherwise returns the minimum number of operations needed.\n\nTime Complexity: O(61 * N) where N is num1, but with memoization it becomes much more efficient as we don't recompute values we've seen before.\nSpace Complexity: O(N) for the memoization cache.\n\nThe solution handles all the test cases:\n- For num1 = 3, num2 = -2, it returns 3\n- For num1 = 5, num2 = 7, it returns -1",

We consider an array good if it is a permutation of an array base[n].\nbase[n] = [1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n] (in other words, it is an array of length n + 1 which contains 1 to n - 1 exactly once, plus two occurrences of n). For example, base[1] = [1, 1] and base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3].\nReturn true if the given array is good, otherwise return false.\nNote: A permutation of integers represents an arrangement of these numbers.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2, 1, 3]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. However, base[3] has four elements but array nums has three. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]. So the answer is false.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3] (by swapping the second and fourth elements in nums, we reach base[3]). Therefore, the answer is true.\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1, 1]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 1, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 1. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[1] = [1, 1]. Therefore, the answer is true.\nExample 4:\n\nInput: nums = [3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 4, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 4. However, base[4] has five elements but array nums has six. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[4] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]. So the answer is false.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100\n1 <= num[i] <= 200",

First, we find the maximum element in nums, which would be n. This is because base[n] contains numbers from 1 to n.\n\n2. We check if the length of nums matches the expected length of base[n]. base[n] should have n+1 elements.\n\n3. We create a frequency map to count occurrences of each number in nums.\n\n4. We then verify if the frequencies match the pattern of base[n]:\n   - Numbers 1 to n-1 should appear exactly once\n   - Number n should appear exactly twice\n\n5. If all conditions are met, return True. Otherwise, return False.\n\nLet's test with the examples:\n\n```python\n# Test cases\nprint(isGood([2, 1, 3]))        # False\nprint(isGood([1, 3, 3, 2]))     # True\nprint(isGood([1, 1]))           # True\nprint(isGood([3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1])) # False\n```\n\nTime Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input array\nSpace Complexity: O(n) to store the frequency map\n\nThe solution handles all the given test cases correctly:\n- For [2, 1, 3]: Returns false because base[3] should have 4 elements\n- For [1, 3, 3, 2]: Returns true as it's a valid permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]\n- For [1, 1]: Returns true as it's a valid permutation of base[1] = [1, 1]\n- For [3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1]: Returns false as it has wrong length for base[4]",

        "question": "You are given an array nums of length n and an integer m. You need to determine if it is possible to split the array into n non-empty arrays by performing a series of steps.\nIn each step, you can select an existing array (which may be the result of previous steps) with a length of at least two and split it into two subarrays, if, for each resulting subarray, at least one of the following holds:\n\nThe length of the subarray is one, or\nThe sum of elements of the subarray is greater than or equal to m.\n\nReturn true if you can split the given array into n arrays, otherwise return false.\nNote: A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2, 2, 1], m = 4\nOutput: true\nExplanation: We can split the array into [2, 2] and [1] in the first step. Then, in the second step, we can split [2, 2] into [2] and [2]. As a result, the answer is true.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2, 1, 3], m = 5 \nOutput: false\nExplanation: We can try splitting the array in two different ways: the first way is to have [2, 1] and [3], and the second way is to have [2] and [1, 3]. However, both of these ways are not valid. So, the answer is false.\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [2, 3, 3, 2, 3], m = 6\nOutput: true\nExplanation: We can split the array into [2, 3, 3, 2] and [3] in the first step.

For arrays of length 1 or 2, we can always split them regardless of m because:\n   - Length 1 arrays satisfy the first condition (length is one)\n   - Length 2 arrays can be split into two length 1 arrays\n\n2. For arrays of length > 2, we need to ensure that when we split the array, at least one of the resulting subarrays (if length > 1) has sum ≥ m.\n\n3. A crucial observation is that if we want to split an array of length > 2 into n pieces, we must be able to make at least one split where both resulting subarrays are valid according to the rules.\n\n4. For such a split to be valid, if we're splitting an array of length > 2, at least one adjacent pair of elements must sum to ≥ m. This is because:\n   - When we make a split, at least one of the resulting subarrays must have length ≥ 2\n   - That subarray must have sum ≥ m to be valid\n   - The minimum such subarray would be length 2\n   - Therefore, there must be at least one pair of adjacent elements that sum to ≥ m\n\nThe solution has:\n- Time complexity: O(n)\n- Space complexity: O(1)\n\nExample walkthrough:\n\n```python\nnums = [2, 3, 3, 2, 3], m = 6\n\n# Check adjacent pairs:\n2 + 3 = 5 < 6\n3 + 3 = 6 >= 6  # Found a valid pair!\n3 + 2 = 5 < 6\n2 + 3 = 5 < 6\n\n# Since we found at least one adjacent pair that sums to >= m,\n# return True\n```\n\nThis solution correctly handles all the example cases and satisfies all the constraints.

The solution works because:\n   - Each swap moves a ball one position\n   - The minimum number of swaps needed is equal to the total number of positions that all black balls need to move\n\nLet's test with the examples:\n\n```python\n# Example 1: \"101\"\nprint(minSwaps(\"101\"))  # Output: 1\n\n# Example 2: \"100\"\nprint(minSwaps(\"100\"))  # Output: 2\n\n# Example 3: \"0111\"\nprint(minSwaps(\"0111\"))  # Output: 0\n```\n\nTime Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string\nSpace Complexity: O(n) to store the positions of black balls\n\nThis solution is optimal because:\n1. It calculates the minimum number of steps needed\n2. Each black ball must move to its final position\n3. The steps calculated represent the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed to get each black ball to its target position\n\nThe solution works for all constraints:\n- It handles strings of length 1 to 10^5\n- It works with any valid combination of '0's and '1's\n- It's efficient enough to handle the maximum input size",

First, we check if any of the strings has length less than 1 or if the first characters of all strings are not the same. In either case, it's impossible to make the strings equal.\n\n2. We define a recursive helper function `canBeEqual` that takes the three strings and the current number of operations as parameters.\n\n3. In the recursive function:\n   - If all strings are equal, return the current number of operations\n   - If any string has length less than 1 or first characters are different, return infinity\n   - For each string with length >= 2, try removing its last character and recursively call the function\n   - Keep track of minimum operations needed\n\n4. The main function returns the minimum operations found, or -1 if no solution exists.\n\nTime Complexity: O(3^n) where n is the maximum length of the input strings. In worst case, we might need to try all possible combinations of removing characters.\n\nSpace Complexity: O(n) for the recursion stack.\n\nThe solution handles all the test cases:\n- For s1 = \"abc\", s2 = \"abb\", s3 = \"ab\", it returns 2\n- For s1 = \"dac\", s2 = \"bac\", s3 = \"cac\", it returns -1\n\nNote: While this solution works correctly, for very long strings it might be slow due to its exponential time complexity.

First, we create a frequency map to count how many times each number appears in the array.\n\n2. Then, we check if any number appears more than 2 times:\n   * If any number appears more than 2 times, it's impossible to split the array because we need to put that number in both parts, but each part needs distinct elements.\n   * If no number appears more than 2 times, we can always split the array successfully.\n\n3. The logic behind this is:\n   * If a number appears once, we can put it in either part.\n   * If a number appears twice, we can put one occurrence in each part.\n   * If a number appears more than twice, we can't split it properly because we would need to repeat it in at least one part.\n\nLet's test it with the examples:\n\n```python\n# Example 1\nnums = [1,1,2,2,3,4]\nprint(isPossibleToSplit(nums))  # Output: True\n\n# Example 2\nnums = [1,1,1,1]\nprint(isPossibleToSplit(nums))  # Output: False\n```\n\nTime Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of nums\nSpace Complexity: O(n) to store the frequency map\n\nFor Example 1:\n- Frequency map: {1:2, 2:2, 3:1, 4:1}\n- No number appears more than 2 times\n- We can split it as [1,2,3] and [1,2,4]\n- Returns true\n\nFor Example 2:\n- Frequency map: {1:4}\n- 1 appears 4 times, which is more than 2\n- Cannot split into two arrays with distinct elements\n- Returns false",

We take input N (number of games) and S (string of results)\n\n2. In the `find_winner` function:\n   - We keep track of number of wins for each player\n   - We also keep track of the last win position for each player\n   - We iterate through the string S:\n     * If character is 'T', increment Takahashi's wins and update his last win position\n     * If character is 'A', increment Aoki's wins and update his last win position\n\n3.

We count the occurrences of each character and @ symbols in both strings S and T.\n\n2. For each character that appears in S:\n   - If it doesn't appear in T, we need enough @ symbols in T to match\n   - If it appears less in T, we need enough @ symbols in T to make up the difference\n\n3. Similarly, for each character that appears in T:\n   - If it doesn't appear in S, we need enough @ symbols in S to match\n   - If it appears less in S, we need enough @ symbols in S to make up the difference\n\n4. If at any point we don't have enough @ symbols to make the necessary replacements, we return False.\n\n5. If we can make all necessary replacements, we return True.\n\nThe solution handles all the test cases:\n\n- For \"ch@ku@ai\" and \"choku@@i\", we can replace the @s to make both strings \"chokudai\"\n- For \"ch@kud@i\" and \"akidu@ho\", we can rearrange and replace @s to make both strings \"chokudai\"\n- For \"aoki\" and \"@ok@\", it's impossible to make them match\n- For \"aa\" and \"bb\", it's impossible to make them match\n\nThe time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input strings, and the space complexity is O(1) since we're only storing counts of lowercase English letters.",

Reading the input grid dimensions and the grid itself.\n\n2. For each possible starting position (r, c) in the grid:\n   - For each possible direction (including diagonals)\n   - Check if we can make 5 steps in that direction without going out of bounds\n   - Check if the sequence of letters in that direction forms \"snuke\"\n\n3. When we find a valid sequence:\n   - Return the positions of all 5 cells\n   - Convert to 1-based indexing and print\n\n4. The solution handles all the requirements:\n   - Ensures cells are contiguous (by moving in fixed directions)\n   - Ensures cells form \"snuke\"\n   - Ensures centers are on a straight line at regular intervals (by using fixed direction steps)\n\nThe solution will find the unique sequence that satisfies all conditions and print the positions in the required format.\n\nFor the sample inputs:\n- It correctly finds horizontal sequences (Sample Input 1)\n- It correctly finds diagonal sequences (Sample Input 2)\n- It correctly finds vertical sequences (Sample Input 3)",

First, we read the input: N, M, D and the arrays A and B.\n\n2. We sort both arrays A and B in ascending order. This helps us efficiently find pairs that satisfy the difference condition.\n\n3. We use two pointers (i and j) starting from the end of both arrays (since we want to maximize the sum).\n\n4. For each position:\n   - If the absolute difference between current elements (A[i] and B[j]) is ≤ D, we've found a valid pair.\n     We update max_sum if this pair gives a larger sum.\n   - If B[j] is too large compared to A[i], we decrease j to try a smaller value from B.\n   - If A[i] is too large compared to B[j], we decrease i to try a smaller value from A.\n\n5. We continue this process until we exhaust either array.\n\n6. Finally, we return max_sum (which will be -1 if no valid pair was found).\n\nThe solution handles all the given test cases correctly:\n\n- For Sample Input 1: Returns 8 (3 from A and 5 from B)\n- For Sample Input 2: Returns -1 (no valid pairs exist)\n- For Sample Input 3: Returns 2000000000000000000\n- For Sample Input 4: Returns 14 (9 from A and 5 from B)\n\nTime Complexity: O(N log N + M log M) for sorting, and O(N + M) for the two-pointer traversal.\nSpace Complexity: O(1) additional space (not counting input storage).\n\nThe solution handles large numbers correctly as Python has built-in support for large integers, and it efficiently finds the maximum possible sum while respecting the difference constraint D.",
