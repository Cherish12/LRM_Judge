Thus, the combined rate of filling by pipe A and draining by the leak is \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\) of the tank per hour.\n\nLet the rate at which the leak empties the tank be \\( x \\) (in fraction of the tank per hour).

        "response_A": "Let me help you solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's identify what we know:\n   * Total pens = 8\n   * Defective pens = 3\n   * Non-defective pens = 8 - 3 = 5\n   * Customer selects 2 pens\n\n2) We need to find the probability that NEITHER pen is defective.\n   * This means both pens must be from the 5 non-defective pens.\n\n3) Let's use the concept of favorable outcomes divided by total possible outcomes.\n\n4) Total possible outcomes when selecting 2 pens from 8:\n   * This is a combination C(8,2) = 8!/(2!(8-2)!) = 28\n\n5) Favorable outcomes (selecting 2 non-defective pens from 5):\n   * This is C(5,2) = 5!/(2!(5-2)!) = 10\n\n6) Therefore, probability = 10/28 = 5/14\n\n7) Looking at the given options:\n   a) 2/10\n   b) 3/11\n   c) 4/13\n   d) 5/14 ✓\n   e) 6/17\n\nThe answer is d) 5/14\n\nThis represents the probability of selecting 2 non-defective pens from the box.",
        "response_B": "To find the probability that neither pen will be defective, we need to calculate the probability of selecting 2 non-defective pens out of the total 5 non-defective pens in a box of 8 pens.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 pens from 8 pens:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the number of ways to choose 2 non-defective pens from the 5 non-defective pens:\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n\\]\n\nThe probability that neither pen is defective is the ratio of the number of ways to choose 2 non-defective pens to the total number of ways to choose any 2 pens:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\binom{5}{2}}{\\binom{8}{2}} = \\frac{10}{28} = \\frac{5}{14}\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\( \\text{d) } \\frac{5}{14} \\).",
